speerflavor.1.t:0 "반란 계획"
speerflavor.1.d:0 "프랑크푸르트 크루프 가의 뒷골목은 밤에는 찝찝하고 우중충한 장소였다. 지나가는 경비대원들조차 거의 찾아오거나 검문을 하지 않았다. 사방을 지역 크루프 공장으로 둘러싸여 다양한 종류의 철제품을 생산하는 이곳은 아주 비밀스러운 류의 만남을 위해서는 완벽한 장소였다. 실제로, 벽을 등 뒤에 대고 조용히 서서 동지들이 합류하기를 기다리고 있는 한 남자가 그곳에 있던 이유가 그것이었다.\n\n차례로 그들은 집이라고 불리는 골목들로 발걸음을 옮겼다. 똑같은 벽들을 몰래 넘어가고 때때로 도로 한가운데를 비추는 느린 회전등 불빛을 피하면서. 마른 몸매를 가진 마지막 공모자가 막사 벽에 뚫린 구멍을 통해 빠져나와 벽 쪽으로 미끄러져 내려오자, 처음부터 그곳에 있던 자는 안도의 한숨을 쉬었다. 마지막에 온 사람이 돌아오기를 처음부터 있던 사내는 열심히 기도하고 있던 터였다.\n\n"그래, 라스무스. 그들이 대답은 했나?"\n\n"A동은 준비를 마쳤어. 당장 실행하고 싶어서 안달이 나있더군."\n\n다른 남자는 간신히 기쁨의 웃음을 참았다. "제기랄, 너무 잘 되어가고 있잖아! 우리 모두가 무기를 들고 독일인을 뒤쫓으리라곤 생각도 하지 못했어!"\n\n"정말 엄청난 기적이지, 미키타." 옆에 있던 다른 남자가 입술에 희미한 미소를 지으며 말했다. 이 사내는 다른 모든 사람들보다도 오랫동안 노예로 살아왔으며, 수년동안 기계와 도구를 가지고 고군분투하고, 항상 나치의 지배 하에 있었다. 마침내 노예들이 주도권을 되찾아오고 있었다.\n\n"얀. 자네 투쟁의 선두에 서고 싶다고 하지 않았나?" 처음으로 입을 연 사내가 조금 전 미소를 지은 사내에게 물었다. 얀은 다시 웃음을 지었다.\n\n"미하일. 물어볼 필요도 없어. 내가 직접 시작할거야. 자네가 있든 없든."\n\n"그러면 그렇게 하자고." 미하일은 몸을 곧추 세웠다. 불편한 노예복은 바닥에 던져버렸다. "친구들에게 말하게. 3일 안에 시작할 거야. 우린 경비대원들을 압도할 것이고, 공장을 탈취한 뒤, 탈출할거야."\n\n"다음에는?" 니키타가 물었다.\n\n"다음에는," 미하일이 말했다. "우린 자유야.""

speerflavor.2.t:0 "충돌, 사격, 반란"
speerflavor.2.d:0 "공장 바닥에는 일상적인 소음을 능가하는 충돌이 발생했다. 마치 천둥이 치고 난 직후처럼 주변이 조용해졌다. 천천히 건물을 서성이던 경비원이 잠시 주의깊게 다가왔다. 그는 더 이상 자주 노예를 처벌하지 않았다. 실제로 지난 며칠 동안 노예들은 그 어느 때보다 조용했다.  다른 동의 경비병들이 지난 며칠 간 일이 너무 굼뜨다며 불평한 것이 자신의 동에서도 마찬가지라는 것을 깨달았을 뿐이었다. 물론 그는 이것을 지켜보고 있는 간부들이 신경을 쓰고 있지 않는다고 확신했다. 혼란이 적다는 것은 생산성이 크다는 것을 의미했다. 하지만 이제 경비병은 마침내 자신이 가진 직업의 힘을 누릴 기회를 얻게 되었다.\n\n그가 범죄를 저지른 자에게 다가가자 다른 노예들은 모세의 기적처럼 양갈래로 나뉘는 것처럼 보였다. 경비원이 전에 여러 번이나 범법을 발견하고 처벌한 적이 있었던 나이 든 노예였다. 그 노예가 사용하던 도구 상자가 바닥에 널브러진 채 누워 있었다. 어리석은 실수군. 처벌을 반드시 받아야겠어. 라고 경비병은 생각했다.\n\n"저거 가져와." 경비병이 말했다. 노예의 발 가까이에 놓여있던 렌치를 가리켰다. 그는 움직이지 않았다. 경비병은 피식 웃었다. 이 새끼는 항상 반항적인 기색을 눈에 띄게 보여왔다. 그는 경찰봉을 꺼내 예의범절을 좀 가르쳐 주기로 결심했다. 빠르고 힘차게 경비병은 경찰봉을 정확히 노예의 가슴뼈에 두었고, 힘을 주어 노예를 뒤로 밀어버렸다.\n\n"저거 가져오라고 임마." 경비병이 다시 말했다. 전보다 소리도 더 크고 위협적이었다. 여전히 노예는 움직이지 않았다. 경비병은 경찰봉으로 노예를 땅바닥으로 내리쳐서 무반응에 화답했다. 마침내 노예는 렌치 쪽으로 기어가 그것을 집어들고, 경비병이 경찰봉을 들고 있듯이 그렇게 서있었다. 경비병은 미소를 지었다. 그가 승리했다.\n\n경비병의 미소는 얼굴에 만연했다. 하지만 그때 노예가 빙글빙글 돌더니 손에 들고 있던 렌치를 경비병의 턱에 내리꽂았다.\n\n경비병은 땅바닥에 쓰러졌다. 별이 눈에 보일 정도로 아팠다. 노기로 충천한 그는 반항을 하고 있는 배은망덕한 인간들을 향해 총을 들어올렸다. 수많은 사람들이 그를 붙잡아 바닥에 쓰러뜨렸고 그의 손에서 권총을 빼앗고자 씨름하면서 총은 천장을 향했다. 그 층 반대편에서는 아무 소리도 들리지 않던 것이 혼란의 소리로 가득 찼다. 그제서야 경비원은 노에들이 얼마나 이 날을 기다려왔는지 생각하며 의식을 잃었다."

speerflavor.3.d:0 "크루프 가가 혼란에 휩싸이자, 한 남자가 빠르게 노예 군중을 뚫고 나아갔다. 얀은 이 모든 사건을 시작한 렌치를 아직도 들고 가슴 위에 손을 올리고 있었다. 그는 이 혼란을 뚫고 나아가서 지도자 동지를 찾고 있었다. 그를 알아보고 칭찬과 찬사를 아끼지 않는 사람들이 그의 일을 더욱 어렵게 했다. 드디어 그는 영원히 계속될 것만 같던, 밀고 밀치는 작업을 끝내고, 나머지 세 명에게 다가갔다. 미키타, 미하일, 라스무스 모두 거리 위의 철제 연단에 서서 수백명의 노예들이 자유를 위해 탈출하거나 공장 무기고의 활짝 열린 문을 통해 무기를 손에 들고 있거나, 언젠가는 닥쳐올 경찰들의 대응에 대비하기 위해 도시 곳곳을 바리케이드로 막는 것을 지켜보고 있었다. 얀이 그들과 합류하자, 라스무스의 눈은 경비병들과 간부들을 묶은 사슬로 향했다. 모두 인질들이 묶여 있는 공장으로 호송되었다. 그들만 인질인 것은 아니었다.\n\n"...생각했던 것보다 4동을 진압하는데 시간이 오래걸렸어. 그래도 끝은 냈군. 저거 보게. 영웅이 납셨어." 라스무스는 얼굴에 미소를 띤 채 얀을 돌아보았다. "2동은 어떻게 되고 있어, 얀?"\n\n"완벽해. 날 쫓아왔던 그 좆같은 새끼를 못으로 박아버렸지. 그 더러운 아가리를 가진 경비원을 보게 되면 내 안부인사 전해줘. 자네들은 어떤가, 동지들?"\n\n"1동과 3동은 매끄럽게 끝났어." 미하일이 말했다. "그런데 4동은 우리가 생각했던 것보다 좀 더 오래 걸렸어. 경비병들이 이 장소를 걸어잠글 때까지 거기 있는 사람들은 우리가 시작한 일을 깨닫지 못할 거야. 어찌되었든, 모든 계획이 성공했네."\n\n그 사내들은 소동을 지켜보며 거리를 내려다보았다. 얀의 두 눈은 한 무리의 노예를 바라보고 있었다. 프랑크푸르트 쪽으로 향하고 있는 자들이었다. 그들은 크루프 가와 다른 도로가 만나는 교차로에 다다랐다. 그러고 그들은 얼어붙었다. 갑자기 그들은 들을 수는 없지만 입으로 소리를 지르며 바리케이드 뒤쪽으로 빠르게 도망쳤다. 바리케이드 안에 남아있는 사람들 사이에서 한바탕 소란이 일어났다.\n\n지도자들이 소동이 일어나는 쪽으로 고개를 돌리자 혼란의 이유가 무엇인지 분명해졌다. 세 대의 경찰차가 모퉁이를 질주하다가, 끼익 소리를 내며 멈춰섰다. 패닉에 빠진 노예들이 총을 마구 쏴대자 당황한 그들은 속력을 높여 달아났다. 총알이 경찰차에 부딪혀 쨍하는 소리가 계속 났지만, 그들은 결국 지역을 벗어났다. 네 사람은 서로를 바라보았다. 무엇이 다가올지 알고 있었다.\n\n"방어를 강화해야겠군." 미키타가 계단을 내려가며 말했다. "어떤 일에도 준비가 되어 있어야 해. 그리고 형제들이여, 이게 우리의 마지막이 된다면 할 수 있는 한 많은 것들을 뺏어버리도록 하게."\n\n사내들은 아무 말도 하지 않았다. 해야 할 일이 있었다."

speerflavor.4.d:0 "요한의 순찰차는 그렇게 빨리 움직이는데 익숙치 않았고, 모퉁이마다 그렇게 거칠게 운전대를 트는 것에 항의라도 하는 듯이 꽥꽥하는 소리를 냈다. 차 안에서 요한은 골똘히 경찰 무전기를 듣고 있었다. 흘러오는 수많은 정보를 통해 혼자서 어떤 사실이나 진술을 생각해내기 위한 몸부림이었다. 프랑크푸르트로 노예들이 탈출하여 대혼란을 야기하고 있다는 이야기는, 전반적으로 혼란이 빚어지고 있다는 보고와, 수차례 총성, 라디오 방송 진행자가 점점 당황하면서 라디오 질서 회복에 실패하고 있는 모습으로 바뀌었다. 어느 것도 요한에게는 중요하지 않았다. 그는 명령을 받았고, 무엇을 해야 하는지 이미 알고 있었다.\n\n분명히 그와 같은 장소를 향하는 것처럼 보이는 순찰차 두 대가 뒤에 멀찍이 떨어져 있었다. 그는 중앙대로를 맹렬히 달렸다. 경찰차들이 굉음을 내며 지나갈 때 도로변에는 차들이 버려진 채 방치되어 있었다. 이는 공장들이 몰려 있던 구역을 뒤덮고 있던 혼란이 여기까지 퍼져왔음을 보여주는 증거였다. 드디어 요한과 다른 이들은 설치된 경계에 차를 세웠다. 그러고는 혼돈 그 자체인 장면을 목격했다.\n\n도로는 전부 비어 있었다. 경찰이 있다는 것은 도망치는 노예들이 다시 그들의 구멍으로 돌아가도록 겁먹게 하기에 충분했다. 반란을 일으킨 공장 바로 앞에 경계선이 설치되면서 반란군은 완전히 봉쇄되었다. 걱정, 분노, 그리고 무엇보다 혼란에 가득 찬 경찰관들이 각자 경찰용 바리케이드를 설치하면서 수다를 떨었다.\n\n요한은 차에서 나와 그가 알아볼 수 있는 가장 가까운 사람에게 향했다. 경위가 다가오는 것을 보자 순경은 재빨리 주의를 끌었다.\n\n"슈나이더 순경. 가능하면 상황 보고 해주게." 요한이 무뚝뚝하게 말했다.\n\n"이런 광경을 정말 본 적이 없습니다, 경위님. 컨테이너를 뒤집어서 바리케이드를 치고, 문과 창문 곳곳에 판자를 박아넣었으며, 곳곳에서 무기를 가져왔습니다. 망할 요새를 짓고 있단 말입니다." 슈나이더가 숨을 헐떡거렸다. 요한은 경찰과 반란군 사이에 있는 모퉁이를 향해 걸어갔다. 그는 슈나이더가 한 말을 확인하기 위해 잠시 고개를 반란군 쪽으로 기웃거렸다.\n\n비록 요한은 내전에 참전한 경력이 있지만, 작업복을 입은 노예들이 라이플, 권총, 샷건을 들고 이를 악물며 바리케이드를 지키고 있는 광경에 입을 떡하고 벌릴 뻔했다. 정말로 이런 광경은 어디서도 본 적이 없는 것 같았다. 그는 너무나도 충격을 받아 벽에 여러 발의 총알이 쏟아지는데도 슈나이더가 직접 그를 모퉁이 안쪽으로 끌어들여야 할 정도였다.\n\n"경위님. 제 말을 이제 이해하셨습니까?" 슈나이더가 물었다."

speerflavor.5.d:0 "슈페어는 두 손에 얼굴을 묻고 싶었다. 물론 이는 그에게 일어난 일이었다. 노예 반란이 성공하기만 한다면 이건 그의 책임이었다. 그의 맞은편에는 4인방이 앉아있었다. 각자는 슈페어처럼 풀이 죽어있었다. 그들의 옆에는 언제나처럼 침착한 한스 슈파이델이 앉아있었다. 비록 그가 조금 불편하다는 듯이 안절부절 못하는 모습을 보이며 조금은 걱정스러운 기색을 내보였지만 말이다. 이들은 때때로 슈페어의 책상 위에 놓인 전화기를 쳐다보곤 했다. 분명 그 전화는 페르디난트 쇠르너의 목소리와 함께 울릴 것이 분명했기 때문이다. 슈페어는 그 소식을 들었을 때 이미 쇠르너의 얼굴에 나타난 환희의 표정을 상상할 수 있었고, 앞으로 닥칠 것을 생각하며 혀를 끌끌 차며 몸서리를 쳤다.\n\n"그래." 슈페어가 조용히 말했다. "공장에 노예들은 총 몇 명인가?"\n\n헬무트는 불편할 정도로 안절부절 못했다. "약 800명입니다, 총통 각하."\n\n"주여." 슈페어가 한숨을 내쉬었다. "아직도 싸우려 하는 자들은 어느 정도 되는가?"\n\n길고 불편한 침묵이 공기를 가르고 있었다. 사무실 안의 남자들은 서로를 쳐다보고만 있었다. 마침내 슈파이델이 입을 열었다. "200명에서 300명 사이로 추정합니다만, 공장 단지 내에 얼마나 많은 사람들이 있을지 알 방법이 없습니다."\n\n모두가 들을 수 있을 정도로 슈페어는 끄응하는 소리를 냈다. "왜 우리가 진입하지 않는 건지 모르겠군. 공장을 되찾아서 이 난장판을 끝내자고."\n\n"그러면 그 안에 있는 수많은 인질들은 어떡합니까?" 슈미트가 물었다. "국방군을 투입한다면, 운이 좋아야 인질 10명만 구할 수 있을 겁니다."\n\n"그것뿐만이 아닙니다." 키징어가 끼어들었다. "인근 대학의 학생들이 경찰의 순찰을 피해 노예들이 탈출할 수 있도록 돕고 있다는 보고를 받았습니다. 군대를 총동원해버리면 아주 심각한... 반응을 목도하게 될 겁니다."\n\n"굳이 정치적인 문제를 지금 언급해야 합니까? 우리는 역사상 최악의 인질 사건을 마주하고 있습니다." 슈파이델이 끼어들었다.

"각하께서 빨리 하실수록 희생자는 줄어들 것입니다. 그들에게 하나를 허용하기 시작하면, 그 자들은 열을 요구할 것입니다. 결국에는 며칠 안에 통제하지 못하게 될 것입니다."\n\n"고려해보겠네." 슈페어는 수화기를 책상 위에 올려놓으며 단호하게 말했다. 쇠르너의 계속되는 고함소리는 뒤이은 소란과 함께 겨우겨우 들렸다.\n\n그 순간, 4인방은 서로에게 반대의 목소리를 부르짖기 시작했다. "살인자", "돼지", "등신"이라는 외침은, 슈페어가 보기에 쇠르너를 향한 말인 것 같았고 방 곳곳에 울려퍼졌다. 슈페어의 표정은 아직도 변함이 없었다. 마침내 슈파이델이 일어섰다. 나머지 사람들은 말을 멈췄다.\n\n"총통 각하, 제 생각에는 이 문제에 대해 결정을 내리기 전에 제 말을 끝까지 들어주셔야 할 것 같습니다. 방금의 폭발적인 반응으로 미루어 봤을 때, 각하의 이 회의에 참여한 사람들도 각자의 제안이 있을 거라 생각합니다." 슈파이델이 말했다. 슈미트가 이끌던 4인방은 동의의 목소리를 냈다."

"당신들은 너무 규율에 사로잡혀서 상황의 인간적인 면을 볼 수 없기 때문에 이딴 제안이나 내놓는 거요! 이제는 결정을 내리셔야 할 때입니다, 총통 각하! 우리가 협상에 나서지 않으면, 프랑크푸르트의 거리는 피로 가득 차고, 개혁과 노예의 자유에 대한 우리의 주장은 다시는 실현될 수 없을 것입니다!"\n\n슈페어는 잠시동안 조용히 있었다. 그는 생각할 수 있는 모든 가능성을 떠올려보았다. 방 안의 사람들은 조용히 서있었다. 독일을 영원히 바꾸어 놓을 수도 있는 대답을 기다리면서."

"오늘 밤에 사임하는 편이 낫겠어." 그 말과 함께 슈미트는 방을 나갔다. 4인방의 나머지 세 명도 함께했다. 그들은 잠시 슈페어를 바라보기만 했다. 의심할 여지 없이 하고 싶은 말을 참는 듯했다.\n\n"슈파이델 장군, 난 올바른 결정을 했어. 자네도 알고 있으리라 믿네. 육군은 우리의 행동이 너무 과하다고 생각할리 없고, 이렇게 하지 않으면 보수파는 나를 파멸시킬 걸세..." 슈페어는 말을 멈췄다. 슈파이델은 아무 말도 하지 않았다. 힘차게 몸을 돌려 밖으로 나갈 뿐이었다. 슈페어는 사무실에 홀로 남아 자신의 결정을 복기해보았다."

"쇠르너 장군, 자네 내가 한 말 들었나?"\n\n길고 불편한 침묵의 순간이 지나갔다. 마침내 쇠르너 원수의 차가운 목소리가 돌아왔다.

"해산!"\n\n안토닌의 마음은 폭풍처럼 혼란스러웠다. 1년 전 고트프리트가 말한 것이 정말 현실이 된다고? 정말 고향에 돌아갈 수 있는 건가? 왜 많고 많은 시간 중에 하필 오늘이지?! 지난 2년 동안 알고지내던 고트프리트가 그에게 다가오자 그는 가슴 한 편이 먹먹해지는 것을 느꼈다. 잠시 동안 그는 고트프리트를 바라보았다. 마치 자신이 독일인인 것처럼. 하지만 그런 감정은 빠르게 다시 사라졌다.\n\n"너- 너가 옳았어..." 안토닌이 입을 열었다. 고트프리트는 조용히 고개를 끄덕였다. "이제 기차를 타서 도시로 향해야겠어. 하루만에 이런 일이 벌어지다니. 이렇게 빠르고 이렇게 갑자기 모든 일이 벌어지다니..." 그가 말을 멈췄다.\n\n고트프리트는 고개를 저었다. "나라고 너를 잘 아는 건 아니야, 안토닌. 하지만 너와 대화를 나누던게 그리울 거라는 건 알고 있어." 안토닌은 고트프리트를 조심스레 바라보았다. 그는 목이 메여왔다."

"여기 와본 적이 있어." 그는 반복하여 생각했다. 어떻게든 생각을 마치고 싶었다. "이 엔진의 굉음소리와 앞에 있는 여러 색깔들. 다 알아보겠어. 너무 익숙해. 결코 잊을 수 없어." 어떻게 그럴 수 있었을까? 만일 잊어버린다면 그는 자신을 사람으로 만들어주는 마지막 것도 잃는 것이었다. 그렇게 된다면 그는 현실의 잔인한 변덕에 사로잡히기를 기다리며 텅 비고 공허로 가득 찬 곳에서 허우적대는 껍데기에 불과할 것이다. "여기 와본 적이 있어. 여기에 처음 왔을 때, 나는 다른 곳에 가리라고는 생각도 하지 못했어. 그런데 그랬지. 하지만 이제 돌아왔어."\n\n안토닌은 생각하지 않았다. 어떻게 생각을 할 수 있겠는가? 생각을 하기 시작한다면, 그는 감히 바라볼 수 없었던 오랫동안 잊은 기억을 열어젖히기만 할 뿐이다. 여기 이 기차에서 그는 혼자였다. 완전한 혼자였다. 이 칸에는 그 외에 아무도 없었다. 사색에 빠질 만한 이유도 충분했고, 시간도 충분했다. 하지만 그는 마음을 닫아놓기로 선택했다. 자신을 뒤덮어버릴 것 같은 마음속의 불꽃을 없애버린 그는 아무 생각도 하지 않고 들판만 바라볼 뿐이었다. 들판은 초록빛으로 물들어 끝없이 펼쳐져 있었다.\n\n비록 생각은 하지 않았지만 그는 엔진이 통통거리는 소리를 싫어했다. 철로를 달리며 덜컹대는 소리는 마치 놀이기구에서 내릴 때처럼 숨을 멈추게 만들었다. 그의 주변에는 아무것도 없었지만, 들을 수 있던 것은 지난 30년 동안 항상 들어온 소음 뿐이었다. 그는 손끝의 통증도 느끼지 못했다. 시야에 있는 모든 것들은 딱히 형체가 없는 색으로 가득 찬 방울과 소용돌이로 번졌고 마음 속은 더욱 혼란해졌다. 1시간, 2시간, 3시간이 지나도록..."

"당신 뭔가 이상한 것 같아요. 비틀비틀 돌아다니다가 누군가 깔아뭉개주었으면 하는 것 같아요. 길들여진 동물처럼 말이죠. 맞죠?"\n\n그 말은 바로 안토닌의 주의를 끌었다. 그는 소리를 질렀다. "당신 미쳤어? 뭐라 지껄이는 거야?"\n\n"내가 틀린 말 했나요? 당신 좀 공허해 보여요, 친구. 오랫동안 빼앗겨왔던 무언가를 간절히 원하는 듯한 눈치라고요."\n\n"그럼 그게 뭔거 같은데?" 그가 조용히 되물었다. 얼굴에는 이미 걱정이 드러났다.\n\n"기회요." 그녀가 말했다. 작은 미소가 입술에 번지고 있었다.\n\n"기...회?" 안토닌이 되물었다. 그 단어가 머릿속에서 메아리쳤다. 정녕 그것이 그가 헤메고 있던 것인가? 평생 동안 노동해오면서 그는 기회를 잃어버렸다는 이유로 독일인들에게 공포를 가진 적이 없었다. 그러면 지금은...?\n\n"오랫동안 가지지 못한 것을 되찾으려 하잖아요. 나만큼이나 당신도 알지 않겠어요?" 그녀는 무슨 잃어버린 유물에 대해 말하는 것처럼 물었다.

"기만자! 기만자! 기만자!" 그를 빙 둘러싼 수천 개의 그림자가 외쳤다.\n\n커다란 소리와 함께 슈미트는 서류 가방을 집어던졌다. 거울은 산산조각이 났고 환상은 갑작스레 없어졌다. 슈미트는 두려움에 휩싸여 덜덜 떨고 울면서 주변을 둘러보았지만, 그의 시야에는 아무것도 보이지 않았다. 그는 무릎을 꿇고 스스로를 껴안으며, 마치 모든 것에서 자신을 보호할 수 있는 것처럼 같은 말 만을 반복했다."

 speerflavor.48.t:0 "Briefing"
 speerflavor.48.desc:0 "Erich set his pencil down and looked around him. Rows upon rows of stark, artless, and utilitarian white metal chairs and desks - yet there was only one attendant. The room was as plain as its contents. A single, rectangular lamp at the center, and a blackboard with the map of the IG Farben's Headquarters before him. He felt a compulsion to review his notes, something new to him. Rifling through the yellow-tinged, neatly-lined pages of his notebook, he read it with a kind of indolent alacrity.\n\n"Any questions," the briefing instructor said, "Herr Fischer?" The man giving him the lay-down was the very picture of Aryan vitality. That is to say, the types that the Reich's racial hierarchy helped survived and flourish. Bureaucrats with nothing to do but to endlessly recount past data and extrapolate into the future, all to no avail. Like lines washed away by the waves. If Erich were to be honest, he hated them.\n\nOn this occasion, however, he found their fastidious, annoying attention to detail useful. Even idiots with no sense of initiative and foresight could find work in the RND. "Say," he said to the instructor, keeping the tone as level and cool as his head, "can you summarize, briefly, what I am to do here? We both know we need to get back to work quickly, so the sooner the better, sir."\n\n"In brief, what you are sent there to do is to intelligence gathering," the instructor said, pointing pointlessly at the map, "but the risk is incredibly high. If IG Farben were to discover you, the RND has never had you as its employee."\n\n"What kind of intelligence?"\n\n"Account books, implications of customer abuse, violations of the labor laws, that sort of thing."\n\n"Sounds like a dull assignment."\n\n"Oh," the man seemed struck with Erich's cockiness, "I assure you, nothing about this assignment is dull. Now, Herr Wessel has granted you a lot of leeways to choose your moment. When will it be?""

 speerflavor.49.desc:0 "The headquarters of IG Farben was a truly massive building, and Erich had a vague idea of how much Hermann Josef Abs wanted to drive the point home that he was a powerful businessman. It was barely illuminated under the pale moonlight, but the front of the building was fixed with a bright light, showing three guards, all armed with fully-automatic rifles, patrolling and standing guard. It was not as heavy security as Erich expected it to be, but then again, it was merely the entrance. The inside, he was certain, would be far less forgiving.\n\nHe was already fond of nature before, but he was even more fond of it when it allowed him to sneak from the side and crouch towards the front, thanking his training that allowed him to move quietly across the grass. When he got near the entrance, Erich sunk back into the shadows as a guard passed him by, and prayed to whatever deity was watching as he moved out towards were momentarily unoccupied as all three guards were to busy patrolling the street in front to pay attention to the man rapidly walking up the stairs and towards the set of glass doors.\n\nAlready his brow furrowed with sweat as the doors swung open and closed behind him with a silent, but still painful creak. Then his eyes flicked upwards and spotted the outline of a camera on the other side of the room, beginning to turn to where he was. With quick reactions, Erich leaped to the nearest pillar and dragged himself down it before sitting on his behind, letting out a sigh of relief. Already, he risked failure. But then again, he had no room to complain."

 speerflavor.50.desc:0 "There was not only one camera there, but two. Thankfully, after waiting for a few minutes, Erich managed to slip past both of them as he went up the stairs and climbed to the second floor of the building. The first, he knew, would not provide anything to him. The second, however, had the possibility of giving incriminating evidence. At least, that's what he was told. Opening a door, Erich listened in before moving into an empty office cubicle, getting down under the desk as his ears perked up. He wasn't alone in this place. There were more guards here. Two more, judging by the footsteps of one farther ahead and the talking of one closer to him. He let a minute pass before he moved out.\n\nErich knew that he wouldn't find anything in these cubicles, so he had to search for an office. When he crossed the short hallway separating one set of cubicles from another, he felt his chest tighten as one of the guards rounded the corner to the hallway he had left moments before. Had Erich been a second slower, he would've been caught. Circling around the large room, he spotted a few more rooms to the side, but one caught his interest.\n\nWaiting until the footsteps turned stiff and then turned silent off in the distance, Erich pushed open the glass door and read the nameplate that was on the desk.\n\n'RHINELAND REGIONAL OVERSEER'."

The bad news was that he had to look through the office, while also not drawing attention to himself. Erich knew the overseer's office had a camera in the corner, and every time it passed by him, he was tempted to bite his lip. The RND promised him that some cameras in the building would've been sabotaged - rolling the same footage throughout the night, as an example, which would give him infinite breathing room. They had even been so kind as to mark out which cameras were sabotaged, and which were not. All Erich hoped for was the Reich was wise enough to not underfund the agency's equipment. Oh, how he hoped.\n\nThe things he discovered during his tenure in the overseer's office was... quite interesting, to say the least. For everything related to the Rhineland, practically the industrial metropolis of the Reich, the numbers purported in several of the documents that Erich looked over... did not align with what IG Farben reported. In essence, what were lucrative trade deals and massive investments coupled with generous loans and promises of high quality products were all much less than expected. Such ideas would dig heavily into IG Farben's budget, but promising them would mean an injection of funds from the government, and an increase in business dealings.\n\nNot bad, Erich thought. They were effectively ripping off millions, and these papers could potentially mean at least a partial incrimination of IG Farben's staff. The question, however, remained.\n\nWas this enough?"

Even though he put his life on the line, at least the result would be dismantling an empire built on slavery. It wasn't Hitler's empire, but... the flicker of good came in steps at a time.\n\nThe moment Erich stepped out of the office, however, he heard something that nearly shot his heart from his chest. A loud, piercing noise that went from ear to ear, and then a shout. The RND failed to do what they were meant to do.\n\n"ALARM!"\n\nErich had to act fast. Any moment of hesitation and he would've been dead. Drawing his silenced pistol, he rushed towards the exit of the room and narrowly avoided one of the guards passing him by. They didn't hear his own footsteps while the alarm blared, it seemed. When Erich looked down the half-spiral staircase down to the lobby, however, he spotted bad news.\n\nTwo guards from the outside made their ways in, and both split paths up either set of stairs. Quickly, Erich huddled himself into the corner, pressing his body against himself as tightly as he could, and waited for the booted footsteps of a man with killing intent to pass by him and into the room he had just left.\n\nBrimming with sweat, he practically flew out of the exit, spotting a guard on the outside that was approaching the building. With a quiet shot that rang out in the night, the man yelled and fell over, bleeding from a leg as Erich made a mad dash into the trees that surrounded the building."

Erich had to move up further, and things wouldn't get easier from there. When he sneaked out of the overseer's office, he made his way to the nearest stairway, and spotted a guard standing like a stone statue near it. He was stuck from moving forward, and he had to act quickly, because the guard on the other side would be making his rounds to here, too - then he would be pincered.\n\nTravelling to a nearby cubicle, Erich spotted a book that hung off of the edge of the desk. It was a thick book, and Erich took a deep breath as he pressed down and heard it slam to the floor with a loud thud. Quicker than the footsteps he heard approaching, Erich returned and hid under the nearby desk, covered in darkness as he saw a pair of legs move past him.\n\nWith a deep breath, he moved his way out and practically rushed to the stairway, silently climbing up the steps and into the third floor. Here there were four guards, he could tell, and once again it was his job to find what he needed on this floor. Then, as he made his way to the right, he spotted it. A crown jewel."

Wasting no time, he hurried his way over to the office before any of the guards had a say in his actions, and made sure to neatly close the door behind him as he saw yet another camera flick back and forth. He put a lot of trust into the RND. Perhaps too much. With a sigh, he began to flip between pages, records, drawers, and the many other things in this office.\n\nEntire minutes passed. He was slowed down heavily by the constant footsteps outside, as he refused to risk entry by means of them hearing the noise inside. Eventually, however, Erich found out a strong curiosity that overshadowed what he had found a floor lower. Records that spoke about Abs' transactions; he was a rich man, perhaps the richest man on the globe, and Erich had a feeling that not all of his wealth was legitimate. Where Abs was supposed to pay the government hefty sums in taxes, he had found loopholes and falsified statements about his income, effectively slashing the money he had to pay to niceties.\n\nErich greedily took the documents with him, adding them to the collection of what he had already gathered previous. With these, he could make for a strong case against IG Farben, and for all intents and purposes, he had done more than enough. He had all the reason in the world to leave, but one piece of information still eluded him. The personal office of Hermann Josef Abs. Would he take the risk, bringing him into almost certain death, or would he remain content with what he had taken, and to return to the RND as capable and clever?

He was wide awake, and his senses on the ready. As he passed cubicle by cubicle, the sound of footsteps drew closer and closer, and Erich knew that more time spent waiting was more time for gaps of error to show. He had to act decisively, and he took a risk by looking out towards the hallway nearby to see if anyone was walking down, and there was. Moving back, he was thankful the guards were tired, as it seemed like that guard didn't notice him poking his head out. When he passed, Erich moved.\n\nThere was another door that he slipped by, and then a set of stairs. Dim, blue light and colorless concrete stairs were his only ally as he made his way up, passing by the fifth floor and then the sixth. Before he reached the seventh, however, there was a sudden conundrum. He heard more footsteps - this time coming from above him. Erich's mind was thrown into a panic for a moment, but he readjusted himself. He was expecting another person, but the guard was not. And so he got up the steps, standing right at the edge, when the guard rounded the corner. Right into Erich's grasp.\n\nWith a lunge, he wrapped his arms around the guard's neck and threw him to the guard, keeping him restrained with what the agency taught him, and using every muscle in his body that the RND forced him to develop. It wasn't difficult to overpower the man, and, after almost ten seconds, he felt him lose consciousness. Dragging his body to a corner, Erich continued moving upwards, knowing he was on a time limit that would kill him if it ran out.

As Erich stepped out, however, he was greeted by something he well and truly dreaded in the back of his mind. The shrill noise of an alarm blared throughout the floor, and voices reverberated from the cubicles and hallways to him. "ALARM!" Was what Erich heard, and he felt a hint of betrayal. The damn RND said that the camera in the accountant's office was sabotaged, and he knew he hadn't been spotted by any of the guards. The ticking timer now turned into a bomb fuse, and Erich had only one way out.\n\nSlamming open the door with his elbow, he quickly made his way down the staircase, but encountered unpleasant resistance along the way. Fortunately, Erich shot first, and the guard only managed to fire one off-balanced shot that pained his ears as he fell on the ground. That would've attracted everyone else, he thought, and it did nothing to ease his worries.\n\nErich began to continue moving down the staircase - he would go to the first floor and pass through the doors in the lobby to the outside, he thought. Then he heard the door of the second floor creak behind him as he was halfway down, and Erich knew he only had moments to respond.

Maximum security was to be employed, and maximum response, too. Instead, he listened in and observed. From here, he could see Abs' office clearly, and the inside was lavish. Paintings hung from the wall he could see, and while he was no art collector, Erich had a feeling they were quite valuable. Elsewhere, Hermann Josef Abs himself was present, talking kindly to two other figures. The first was Friedrich Flick, and the other was Edmund Geileberg.\n\nWith a puff of his cigar, Abs grinned. "Not to worry, dear friends. Speer and his pitiful Gang may think of us enemies, but we have influence abound. So long as we remain cooperative, things will go our way. As they had under the previous Führer." Geilenberg took in his words and spoke nothing, while Flick merely raised an eyebrow. "So certain of that?" He asked, and Abs shrugged. "I wouldn't trust these resources that we have pooled as of right now. I have some... connections that I can pull. Most importantly, extremely efficient and highly drilled troops that could do a variety of tasks. Defending, attacking..."\n\n"You mean to tell me you've hired a mercenary company?" Abs cut in, blowing smoke as he kept his smile. Flick looked puzzled for a second. "Well, they're not exactly a mercenary company-" Abs merely patted him on his shoulder, speaking with a cigar between his teeth. "We won't need any of those 'mercenaries' of yours, Herr Flick. We have our own, but thank you for the offer."\n\nIt was time for Erich to choose. In just a few seconds, he had to formulate a plan of action. To get in, get out, and get the hell out of the building. They were blocking the way, so he had to find some measure to dispose of them. And not only that, but the many guards patrolling the area would make it almost impossible to sneak in. Let alone the cameras. Maybe this wasn't the best idea.

While it was mainly reserved for the soldier who served in the Second World War and the war against the Russian front, I have managed to convince the Wehrmacht to make another one." Wessel's voice came out like a news reporter would speak from a teleprompter, yet Erich could still feel the pride in it as he stood tall, looking towards the agents in their seats who stared at him with glimpses of respect and awe, though nothing further.\n\nHis mind wandered back to the previous nights when he had finally returned to the agency. With everything and more accomplished, Erich was dispatched to meet personally with Gerhard Wessel. That night was one of the stranger nights he had experienced, dealing with a man who showed little emotion and was known as being ruthlessly efficient. Yet when he had handed over what he had found, the man was surprised, shocked and - dare he think it - amazed. They discussed in length everything that was discovered, and, by the end of the night, Erich was promised a reward.\n\n"To Agent Erich Fischer, for his outstanding bravery and skill, will be rewarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves." The clapping began unanimously as Erich shuffled slightly and waited for Wessel to walk over and pin the medal to his shirt. He was no fan of the Iron Cross, and practically disgusted by the swastika embedded into it, but a medal was a medal, and he didn't think of Wessel to care much about the Nazi machine. This victory wasn't of Hitler's cronies and successors. Not of Speer's. It was the success of him, his agency, and the people that would have easier lives when IG Farben was gone.\n\nWhen Wessel pinned the medal, he gave the slightest nod to Erich, who returned it in kind. The ceremony did not last long afterwards, and eventually the agents dispersed to continue their work. The RND was not a place to lounge around, after all. And neither was it in Erich's spirit. Even if he had done of the most dangerous tasks assigned to him, he still had work to do."

 speerflavor.65.t:0 "An Architect's Blues"
 speerflavor.65.desc:0 "Another day, another cartload of problems... In his office at the center of the Reichskanzlei, Albert Speer, Führer of the German people, is tired; tired and stressed. Even after the war's end, there's no rest: the reconstruction is proving more difficult than predicted, and the party bureaucracy is already starting to resist the changes suggested by the Gang of Four. Like the proverbial clay pot, Speer feels powerless to act, a small raft engulfed by the stormy sea. Taken by the sudden need to escape, he stands from his chair and goes to the window: perhaps it will do him some good to gaze at the great Germania he himself designed?\n\nLooking outside, a wave of memories surges from Speer's mind, snippets of a life that was a mere decade ago, and yet feels as if it was another geological era: showing Hitler the progress made as the two friends laugh heartily, visiting construction sites, directing the workforce, and finally the Volkshalle's inauguration, the crowning moment of his life as an architect. It was a different age, one where the future looked glorious, not this... maddening quagmire.\n\nThe more he looks at what he built, however, the more a feeling of dread creeps over him: why is that building over there still unfinished? Why is that apartment block so bare, the slots for the decorations are all empty! More than anything, who is that incompetent who used low-quality stone for the walkways?! They are already full of cracks! As he finds more and more critiques, he also feels something else, a need he had not felt in years: he wants to correct those mistakes, to make them right, but even more, he wants something... new. His hands itch with the need to design, to give tangible form to the things in his mind! How wonderful it would feel to be once more, even if just for a moment, Speer the architect! However, what is an architect without his tools?"
 speerflavor.65.a:0 "Note to self: bring the tools to the office tomorrow."

 speerflavor.66.t:0 "Back to Work!"
 speerflavor.66.desc:0 "As everyone, except the security, leaves the Reichskanzlei, a single light is still on. In the Führer's office, there's still someone working for the good of the German people, or at least this is what the headlines will report, because putting a sign on the door saying "Architekt bei der Arbeit, Zugang verboten" would be a bit misleading...\n\nWith his work completed, the Führer can finally punch out, and let the architect take his place. Speer clears his desk and takes his tools out of the case he had brought from his home: they are old, but they still work, just like him, and that's more than enough! He has awaited this moment for the entire day, and as he looks at the large, empty sheet, he feels like a painter staring at a blank canvas, ready to fill it with his art: all kinds of ideas swim through his mind, from tall, bold skyscrapers to simple houses and small villas. With a trembling hand, he takes up ruler and pencil, and draws the first line.\n\nThe first sheet goes straight to the dustbin, followed by the second and the third. Trembling lines and small blunders irk the perfectionist inside Speer, but more than five years of inaction require some time to catch up. The fourth sheet, however, survives the initial scrutiny: in the end, he has settled on a public office, a classic of his old practise. As the jumbling mess of lines seemingly drawn randomly acquires purpose, and forms itself into the skeleton of a building, a smile creeps itself on Speer's lips: he is finally free from the stress, from the obligations, from the quagmire, doing what he loves!\n\nAfter a while, the architect stretches his arms and looks at his work. The essential frame, the easiest part, is done, now it's time to start the real work! He looks at his watch, and jumps: it's already past midnight! Best going to sleep, or tomorrow work will be a pain... As he goes home, however, he can't help but wonder: will his newest design ever become reality, or will it remain a small closet dream, one to be put in a museum after his death?"

 speerflavor.67.t:0 "An Artist's Dilemma"
 speerflavor.67.desc:0 "The architect looks with satisfaction at his work. The foundations and the main frame of the building he has been painstakingly designing are done and ready to be built: from the quality of the concrete to the exact amount of steel bars needed to sustain the edifice, everything is specified with pinpoint precision in several side notes written in regular handwriting. Now, all it remains is the façade, and this is where the true challenge begins.\n\nWith a sigh, Speer realizes that he never bothered resuming his theoretical studies after he became entangled in the Rechtspolitik - trying to survive in a world where most of your "colleagues" want to kill you is, after all, quite the demanding task - and now he curses himself for not having updated his knowledge. How is he supposed to finish his new masterwork? What will be the final stroke on the canvas?\n\nLooking outside for inspiration, he sees once more his greatest success... with all its flaws and mistakes. Would it be best to follow in his own footsteps, and use the style that forged Germania into what it is now? To act as if nothing changed in the last ten years? For a moment, he thinks of the new, grand structures built in the United States, with their new lines and glass walls: is the future the way forward? To fully let go of the past and find a new beginning?\n\nWith a last look to the Volkshalle, a final thought enters his mind: what if a third way is indeed possible? A fusion of old and new, of past knowledge and future design, a melting pot where both ideals would have to make a small sacrifice for the sake of art... As the Führer-Architekt takes pencil and ruler once more, he has made his decision."
 speerflavor.67.a:0 "My craft is perfect as it is!"
 speerflavor.67.b:0 "Let us forget the past, for the sake of art..."
 speerflavor.67.c:0 "I shall pave a new way for future architects to follow!"

 speerflavor.68.t:0 "The Old Lion Still Roars!"
 speerflavor.68.desc:0 "Yes! All his art has always been for the glory of the Vaterland, and his new design will follow the same rules! With passion, he starts designing the grand façade: it will be a tall, large entrance way with stone walls and columns reminiscing of the Roman temples he so highly admired in his youth, with a staircase leading to the door. Who needs steel and glass, the strength and raw solidity of stone are enough to impress the viewer, just as it did ever since mankind learnt how to sculpt it into the shapes it desired!\n\nOf course, a public building required to always remind those who entered it of its function. The central pediment will sport a single, giant swastika overlooking the entrance, and atop the pediment a tall eagle will spread its wings over the German people, just as the Vaterland spread across the globe in the wake of its victories. Eagle's heads would regularly jut out of the walls, holding banners or other symbols of national socialism, praising the strength of the German nation and its many virtues.\n\nWith the finishing touches done, the architect looks at his masterpiece with satisfaction. He hasn't yet lost his touch after all! Finally standing and stretching his arms, he takes a last look to the great Germania, and finally, he sees it for what it is, his greatest success, perfect as it is! There is no conflict between architect and Führer, for both shall bring the Reich to new heights of power and prominence, as it was before, and as it ever shall be!"
 speerflavor.68.a:0 "Heil me!"

 speerflavor.69.t:0 "Out With the Old, In With the New"
 speerflavor.69.desc:0 "Looking one final time at the city he had designed from top to bottom, Speer finally realizes one thing. His ideals, his beliefs, his convictions are still there, they aren't gone, but he can see with his eyes how the first attempt at their implementation has gone: just like Germania, the Reich is a rotting corpse, and it will take a shock therapy to bring it back to life. One day, Germany will be once more at the forefront - no, it will be at the top - but only after sweeping changes have been accomplished. How can a small architect like himself change the tide with a pencil and a ruler?\n\nSlowly, his design starts to reflect his state of mind: the façade is clean, sharply cut, large glass window framed by black steel architraves, everything in stark contrast to the stone walls and colonnades of his own Reichskanzlei. As his building takes a shape so different from everything he has ever done, he feels a slight insecurity, like a child leaving his mother's embrace to swim on his own for the first time: he's leaving behind his old work, to create something he never thought to create, in a shape he never thought to give, so different from his initial plans; and yet, he knows this is what needs to be done.\n\nAs another evening turns into night, the architect finishes his work. With a last look to his old creations outside the window, and to his newest addition on his desk, Speer understands with painful clarity that he can no longer return to his old art: so much has changed in so little time, so much to learn, so much that he has forgotten. In his sadness, however, there's the seedling to a new relief: he's not done yet, there's one last thing he needs to do before putting his tools to rest.\n\nThe Reich will be born anew, a shining beacon of modernity! Perhaps it won't be the same Germany he had dreamt about in his youth, perhaps such a dream was never supposed to turn into reality, but he'll fight for his nation nonetheless, as he has always done."
 speerflavor.69.a:0 "The future is now, I guess..."

 speerflavor.70.t:0 "Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis!"
 speerflavor.70.desc:0 "As Speer reflects upon his choice, suddenly the truth dawns upon him. Didn't the Romans take the arch from the Etruscans? The columns from the Greeks? Didn't they study the Egyptians and their stylized forms? Yes. Did this make them any less Romans? No! On the contrary, they grew with everything they learnt, every new notion, concept, technique they absorbed! They didn't accept passively the foreign influences, but neither did they remain closed in their own little world: they assimilated all following their own criteria, everything put into the perfect place for it to shine brightest!\n\nThe solution, the breakthrough Speer needed is there! The architect resumes his work, his mind a melting pot. Slim, graceful stone columns hiding the steel inside them, just like his new Germany. Beautiful and proud, a steel gauntlet inside a velvet glove. The glass would take new forms, curved and elegant, fitting into the façade's fronton and reflecting the light into a majestic eagle holding the laurel of victory. A rainbow of colors, mitigated by the pure white of the stone, would marvel the visitors without scaring them, a comforting feeling of brightness and warmth.\n\nAs the first rays of morning relieve his tired eyes, the architect-turned-Führer can't help feeling satisfied. This time, perhaps the first in his entire life, he has created something entirely new: a new style, a new fashion! Perhaps it will never take foot, but it doesn't matter: an artist works for himself first and foremost, and he finally understands that he is, indeed, still an artist. Now, a new work awaits him, his masterwork, the coronation of his craft: to rebuild the Reich! To rebuild it into what it was always meant to be, a nation fully capable of embracing future without forgetting the past! As the cleaning staff opens the door and jumps seeing the Führer still inside, Speer greets them with a wide grin: this is a great day for Germany, the first of many to come! A new dawn, a wonderful dawn!"

 #Speer goes cray

 speerflavor.71.t:0 "Fissive Cracks"
 speerflavor.71.desc:0 "Benno Ohnesorg was dead. That news was already bad enough. What made it ten times worse was the news Speer got immediately following the murder, and he felt both disgust and anger rise in him when he found out.\n\nThe student movement grew a spine and the slaves grew consciousness. They had cast their die and crossed their Rubicon. Now they were not merely protesting, but also clashing with the police. In the streets of Germany, cameras rolled by state-controlled and underground journalists showing the mass panic that rippled through the cities, and the brutality exchanged between police and the rioters-turned-revolutionaries, stoked the growing fear across the nation. It was not received well by the public at large, but Speer received it worse. The slaves - and everyone else associated with them - needed to know their place.\n\nHe did not consult the Gang to make his decision. He had no need to - the next time he held his speech in the cold, dim Volkshalle, he made it clear. The streets would be filled with officers armed with guns. Live ammunition or otherwise. Silence dominated with the occasional approval from those who listened to him, and he met the Gang with cold silence - especially Schmidt, the brazen rat he had no patience dealing with. He knew what he'd say, and he didn't want to hear it.\n\nFor as many concessions as he gave to the pitiful reformist elements that backed him up for so long, he knew he could not disappoint his mentor by giving in to their every demand. It would only bring ruin to Speer's vision. After all, this was the Führer's crisis to solve."

 speerflavor.72.t:0 "Growing and Growing"
 speerflavor.72.desc:0 "Nothing was getting better. The Ehrentribüne was burning, and Speer could only watch. Clearly, the military police he had sent in did nothing to alleviate the anger the rioters felt. The rambunctious fools. The idealistic, short-sighted, animalistic fools. All they knew was chaos and panic, and here they were, burning down one of his most prized constructions. There were so, so many memories in that place. Glory echoed its field, but now it was empty; and did anything good come of it?\n\nPerhaps one thing. Speer's realization that these fools could not be dealt with in peace. He had given them a chance to take the olive branch, and they merely spit on his hand. Now he was in his office - and here stood a member of the Gang. "Minister of War, Henning von Tresckow." Speer coldly called, and Tresckow stood tall, unflinching, gazing at the Führer with an emotionless stare. "The Minister of the Interior is busy, so I'll pass this responsibility onto you. This revolt has gone too far. These madmen must learn what martial law is like."\n\nTresckow shifted uncomfortably. "Herr Speer, I-"\n\nNot a second more did he continue when Speer cut in, quickly and harshly. "That was an order, Henning von Tresckow, and you WILL listen to it. The time for playing games with your liberal demands is over. Germany burns, and I will destroy this alliance before I let this horde burn the rest down like the barbarians pillaged Rome. So I advise you to listen." He couldn't see it, but Tresckow's hands behind his back were clutching against each other tightly, and his finely-cut nails scraped against his skin in anxiety.\n\n"Alright, then." He said, giving a short nod. "Is there anything else you want me to do?"\n\nWas Speer looking at him or through him? He couldn't tell.\n\n"No, Herr Tresckow. I want you to focus all of your attention on this. They will learn the values of violence and discipline. The whip will crack, and..." Speer's fists trembled. "They will learn. As a Prussian, I'm certain you agree." Tresckow's face said anything but. "Now go. You are dismissed.""

He didn't have to read them, of course, he knew exactly what direction this revolt would go. They would push and push, and the Wehrmacht would push back, until finally, the Aryan heel would stomp down and annihilate the petty resistance the revolt gave to submitting to the New Order. The thought soothed his mind a little, but he was still bitter with anger, and a certain someone kept trying to push him down another road.\n\n"My Führer-" Schmidt began, and Speer took no chances, slamming a fist against the desk and glaring at him with rageful, tired eyes.\n\n"This nonsense AGAIN?!" He said, stirring himself into anger. "Helmut Schmidt, know your place. I've spent the past two decades trying to move past web after web, and now you're constantly biting at my ankles, here and there. Who do you think I am, Schmidt? Some sort of peace-loving liberal scum? Perhaps you are, but I am far from such a thing."\n\nSchmidt ground his teeth together, feeling his breathing become heavier. "I've advised you, time and time again, that clashing with the slaves would ruin our international image!"\n\n"To hell with our international image! You..." Speer's eyes narrowed towards Schmidt. "You... lying in bed with the Reichsbanner, aren't you?" Schmidt felt his stomach churn, and he stepped away. "I should have seen this earlier. I should've realized a decade ago. You are more than just some pathetic liberal. I know who you are now, Schmidt - you are a rat! A RAT!" Speer kicked back his chair and stood up, almost frothing at the mouth. "Get out of my office! Get out, you Judeo-Bolshevik bastard! Get out before I have you hanged as an enemy of the state!" Schmidt felt sweat drip down his back as he began walking out, while Speer didn't relent."

Then the tremors returned, and Speer raised his head to look up at the maps on his desk. Here was Germany, powerful and strong, a population of more than a hundred million, built on success after success, and with his guiding hand would steer it into the future. In the east, it was all stripes and circles. The slaves. The whelps. The untermenschen. They had taken so much territory now, and again and again his Aryan people failed him. He would not allow it. No, no, no, no, no. The Führer was no longer Adolf Hitler - it was Albert Speer. He held the power now. He called the shots. All he had to do was make the call. Make the call... make the call...\n\nMake the call.\n\nPapers and office equipment clattered to the floor, and Speer slammed open a drawer, pulling a pen out. The map of Europe remained, and he began scribbling it. Just like when he was back with Hitler, when strategies would be described. He punctured holes into the map to signify where the tanks would blitz. He scribbled across whole areas that would be carpet bombed. Oh, they would learn their place. By gun, bullet, fire, tank. He didn't care what the rest of the world thought. Germany was the master of the world, and everyone else would bend the knee. "And him..." He muttered, voice grazing against his throat with hoarse pain. His eyes flicked to Germany.\n\nSpeer let out a short, raw chuckle. "Helmut Schmidt. You, you Jew. You Zionist little puppet. How I'll see you hang.. m-maybe I'll..." He reached in a hand and barely wrapped his fingers around the grip as he pulled the pistol out, and it clattered weakly on the table. "Yes... yes, that's what I'll do. I don't need to sign papers. I'll just do it myself!" He laughed harder this time, and he furiously drew on the map, a line here, a circle there.

So he anxiously waited for something - and that something came.\n\nWhen Albert Speer received the news that Willy Brandt was now in support of the slave revolt, his mind went into a white haze of rage. Without thinking, he tore the classified document in half, and reached for his gun. He knew where Helmut Schmidt was, and within minutes he knew the Jew would be dead. If only Speer had the patience to give him something worse.\n\nStorming out of his office, he began walking directly to Schmidt's office with only one thing on his mind, but something stopped him. In the dim shadows of the Reichskanzlei he could hear footsteps behind him. Before he could turn around, pain shot through his arms as hands grabbed on tightly, and in front of him walked Reinhard Gehlen. "What the hell are you doing, Gehlen?!" He screamed. "No... you know, you know! What do you know?!"\n\nGehlen gave a small smile as he recovered a thick document and a lighter in each hand. "My Führer." There was no weight to that word. "I have an...interest in keeping things as is.

Here," he continued, flicking the lighter open near the paper, "is your freedom. Choose wisely, Herr Speer. One will end you. The other will free you."\n\nSpeer could barely see anything past unfocused shapes, but he could hear crisply what the man said. His strength failed him as he attempted to break free. "He set you up, didn't you?" He asked, and Gehlen raised an eyebrow. "Schmidt - he did it, he brought you here, he knew what'd happen, didn't he? Didn't he?!" Fury filled his cracking voice, and all he could think about was how Schmidt would look with a bullet in his brain. "Schmidt!" His lungs pained him. "Schmidt!"

Sometimes that woman who talked to him in the factory visited here and there, and they talked. They would talk about current things happening, and she was like a source of information. He learned things outside of his simple life - how the world was in turmoil, how Germany was making this sweeping change and passing this outstanding law.\n\nHow they were still treacherous bastards, and how things would never remain the same, and how day-by-day, things only grew tenser.\n\nAntonin knew it would happen. In fact, he was waiting for it. When he received a pair of knocks on his door, he closed the book in his hands that was about the great Slavic migration into eastern Europe, and unbolted the chain, letting it open slightly so that he could look outside. "Yes?" His old, unused voice asked, and he could see it.\n\nTwo men in uniforms-- and the sign of the Polish Home Army. "Greetings, Antonin Grzywacz. We're here on behalf of the Free Europe army." In his hands he held a rifle that harkened back to old times.\n\n"Will you fight, sir?" The man's face was hard, but sympathetic. "There will be no work for you tomorrow."\n\nAntonin knew that well.\n\n"But I can understand it if you wish to remain here."\n\nSlowly, Antonin unbolted the door completely, and let it open wide. He was old, perhaps even frail, but... Antonin shook his head.\n\n"No, son," he began, holding his hands out. The soldier nodded, and handed him the rifle. "I can still fight. Er..." He looked down, then back up. "Before we go, can I ask you a question?"\n\nThe soldier took no time to respond, even sounding a little enthusiastic. "Of course.""

He was a young boy in Poland... oh, how lovely the fields were all up until the point where they weren't. He grew from a boy into a teenager and from a teenager into a man, and he had settled down with a beautiful girl he knew from across his home - and they had raised three children, one who was just a bit slow but it didn't matter to him nor to her and it never bothered the child's siblings. They had all been beautiful.\n\nHad been beautiful. Then, for the past twenty years, Antonin was a hollow man. The Nazis had taken everything from him, grinding his family into dust and ashes and only spitting him out, untainted yet broken. How he longed for death and for the relentless pain in his mind that followed him day after day. Then things had begun changing. Finally, perhaps, the German was showing mercy. Something else that wasn't sheer cruelty, monstrosity, bloodshed. He had met a man who sparked the flame known as friendship with him, and he was a German. What was his name... he couldn't remember.\n\nThen, one day, they had finally given him his freedom. And at home he met another woman. Her name was Anna, and she was fierce, perhaps a bit younger than him but he had been working up the courage to ask her to go on a date with him. Now he laughed about it, and then drew in a sharp breath. The bullet lodged in his stomach made his body numb and his sight fuzzy, and God how he had hoped that some Nazi would have walked in and put him out of his misery or that some tank rolled over him, or an artillery shell blowing his body into pieces.\n\nNo such thing. No such thing - and no help would ever come. He was abandoned by the frontline, and it had long since moved past him. Long into the night, when his consciousness began fading, Antonin cried. For as much as he wished for death, he was truly afraid of it. He didn't want to let go, even if the pain was overbearing, but reality caught up to him. By the time the sun rose, Antonin was dead."

Many thoughts coursed through his head, but as he glanced between him and Anna, he swallowed back the anxiety.\n\nThe messenger, meanwhile, glowed with positivity. "Good news! Everyone, listen closely. Th-the Reichsbanner managed to haggle with the Germans - we get to go home!"\n\n"What?!"

His confused expression quickly shifted into a joyous grin, and he went to hug Anna, who gladly accepted it.\n\n"We get to go home, Anna," he muttered. "W-we can finally rest. Oh my God, I've been waiting so long for this..."\n\n"And I've still yet to see you fire your gun," Anna replied, giving a short, happy chuckle, and they hugged each-other tighter before letting go.\n\n"I asked if you'd join the resistance back then, and here you are now, a freedom fighter who's gained his freedom without firing a single shot." Her expression sombered, though her smile remained. "Antonin..." She trailed off, as she could notice that he had an anxious look on his face. "What's wrong?"\n\nAntonin rubbed the back of his neck and smiled awkwardly. "S-see, Anna, I... I'm... a widower, to put it bluntly, and I..." Anna's eyes widened.\n\n"I have no ring, but I'm sure I can buy one eventually. Will you-"\n\nAnna leaped in and wrapped her arms around Antonin, and he could feel his eyes swell with tears.

From Albert Einstein to Enrico Fermi, the false doctrine of Jüdische Physik has tried to subvert science from the inside, spreading false beliefs on how the very fabric of the world was structured. It was only a matter of time before the true Aryans would try to cleanse universities and scientific institutes from this filth, and replace it with the true science, the Aryan science!\n\nFrom this cauldron of national pride and racial superiority was Deutsche-Physik born, a titanic effort aimed at replacing the decadent and corrupt Jüdische Physik with a doctrine that truly answered the great questions of our time. However, National Socialism wasn't alone in his quest for truth, and many had already tried, even on their own, to refute such false beliefs on the ground of Aryan rationality. From Hanns Hörbiger's Glazial-Kosmogonie in 1912, many other enlightened intellectuals, such as Nobel laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark understood the need to compile and organize a pure scientific community along the party-approved line of Gleichschaltung, a hierarchical coordination based on adherence to the official doctrine of national socialism."

 speerflavor.80.desc:0 "For almost three decades, Deutsche-Physik was the proverbial stone guest at all scientific meetings in the Reich. While the overwhelming majority of all academic institutions believed such theory with the same fervour a policeman believes the excuses of someone caught pickpocketing, they were forced to keep their criticism for themselves as the Deutsche-Physik had been officially embraced by the NSDAP, and counted personalities such as Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler themselves among its staunchest supporters: to denounce its falsehood meant being branded as a "Juden-freunde" and subsequently purged. As such, an uneasy peace had been struck between the universities and the party leadership: the former would abstain from openly refuting the theory, while the latter would abstain from sending the most esteemed professors to the concentration camps as enemies of the state, especially since their minds were needed for the war effort more than their arms would be in any slave factory.\n\nAfter Himmler's exile and Hitler's death, and with the new Führer set on a more moderate approach to science and politics, the scientific community is once more in upheaval, and many feel that the day of reckoning has finally come. A scientific council has been convened in Germania, where the most prominent academics from the entire Reich will be present to discuss the future of science in this new era for Germany and the world. Even more importantly, the opening event will be a strong, official rebuttal of the entire doctrine of Deutsche-Physik, to be branded as a 'delirium inspired by racial hate and intellectual deficiency'. In its place, the council will ask for the scientific community to be regulated by merit and experience, rather than boot-licking and party allegiance."

Already letters are piling on the Führer's desk, asking him to officially support one side or the other, and the amount is getting close to the alarm threshold: should Speer refuse to take action, it will be interpreted as a sign of weakness, and he can't afford such a thing!\n\nForced to take action, the Führer stops to reflect. Preventing the council from happening is absolutely out of the question, as it will enrage the universities that were his first and largest support base during the Bürgerkrieg, and now are the fundamental pillar upon which to build a new Reich, filling the technological gap separating the country from the other world powers.\n\nAs it stands, there are only two possible choices: the first is to cave in to the conservatives without angering the scientists, which would mean completely ignoring the council and act as if it never happened, a safe choice in difficult times; the second is to openly support the reformists, and attending the council in person, thus sending a clear message to everyone about the new course the Reich is being set on.

At the very center of the Volkshalle, a hemicycle of chairs houses the Reichstag in full extraordinary session, with an adorned armchair topped by a golden eagle at its front for the Führer himself; the scientists will be accomodated in rows upon rows of chairs, with a long, frontal desk for the deans and other directors.\n\nEveryone is in their place, in a perfect choreography directed by the expert eye of Leni Riefenstahl behind the lens of her trusted Olympia-Kanone. At the given signal, everyone stands as the Führer arrives from the Halle's main entrance, the crowd parting for him like the Red Sea before Moses, until he takes his place: with the brightest mind of the Reich before him, and the Reichstag behind him, he addresses the entirety of the German people.\n\n"Citizens of Germania, today marks a new dawn! After long years of exile inflicted upon them by fools and charlatans, we welcome science, rationality and enlightenment back into our fold, never to let it go a second time!"\nA round of applause, then he resumes: "I wanted to be present to this historical day, to let our esteemed researchers and academics know that their plight has been noted by our government: their bright minds, unparalleled skill and selfless dedication to the cause of science shall pave the way for our country to resume its place among the great nations of Earth!"\n"Let science be one with national socialism as it was meant to be, free from the shackles imposed by envious men who believed they could decide whether innovation was pure or not!

A few reichsmarks would have served him well, but to the surprise of noone, he only made enough to buy himself the barest amount of food possible. As his thin and worried frame entered through the door of the office, he could hear the rolling of the train engine and a whistle as it came to a stop - there to pick up more of his kin, but not him - he had something to resolve.\n\n"Mister Vogel?" Marceli asked, seeing the older German sitting on his chair and writing something off perk an eyebrow.\n\n"Herr- ugh," his Polish was rusty as he looked up, "what is problem?"\n\nMarceli took a deep breath.

 speerflavor.91.desc: "Theodor Oberländer looked out before his kingdom, the floor of the Reichstag, and allowed a deep scowl to spread across his face. The assembly was not in session that day, but these chambers were a place where he could think. And, at the moment, Oberländer needed to think, to choose a course. He stood from his seat, where he had heard so many proposals and pressed so many stamps into ink. Allowing his mind to go elsewhere, the man began to pace across the Reichstag floor.\n\nAs one of Hitler's ministers, it had been clear Speer would set the Reich on the right course. Oberländer had seen that for himself, as one of the first members of the Reformist faction. Only fools and yes-men had truly believed there would be no change needed after the West Russian War. As Führer, however... Oberländer could only shudder to think what idiocy Speer would attempt to carve National Socialism into. There was a reason his supporters were called Speerites, and not reformers. Any true reformer would see what inoperable madness Speer's real plans contained.\n\nBut even a Führer did not rule alone. Oberländer had been the sole voice of reason then, and he would continue to be so now. The German people, he believed, would listen to intelligence and reason over the rhetoric of firebrands. The party could easily be led to see that such changes had to be done with a light hand. Speer could be kept in check, if Oberländer held him to account. That would be the doctor's solemn duty. He swore it to himself, his final act of vigil in the empty Reichstag.\n\nSuch was his focus on that promise that he did not notice an aide approach him until the boy spoke. "Herr Oberländer? The Führer would like to speak with you." Oberländer disliked the casual tone with which this child spoke to him. Speer did not grasp the difference between a true reformer, and a rebellious youth mindlessly rejecting that which his parents had taught him. A sneer found his face as he replied."

 speerflavor.92.t: "The Moderate"
 speerflavor.92.desc: "Theodor Oberländer gritted his teeth, approaching the podium after Speer's man, Erhard, had given his due. It had been short, to the point, and wildly disrespectful. Just like the man himself. Nevertheless, had been as radical as one would expect. It was baffling that Speer had chosen such a toad to lead his economic policy, but he had again never been practical. Oberländer allowed the scant applause to dissipate before addressing the assembly.\n\n"Thank you, Herr Erhard." He spoke curtly and nodded to the economist, who did not look very happy to be thanked. "I think we all need to recognize the value in what is being said.I am far from claiming the economy is perfect. However, I am quite worried about the scale on which Herr Erhard describes these changes. This... revolution of the German economy that he suggests is, I must say, rather radical." He noted . "Radical, and very, very, foolhardy."\n\n"Herr Erhard, of course, has made great use of his PhD in economics. He is the Reichsminister of Finance, after all." Oberländer conceded. "But a PhD is something that helps primarily in classrooms and hypotheticals. This sort of plan that he suggests would work wonders in a bubble where there is only economics to consider. My own doctorate in finance, however, shows that I am well-experienced in the realities of putting such things into practice, unlike Herr Erhard. And my doctorate in agriculture, meanwhile, shows that I can tell you how Herr Erhard would rob good German farmers of the chance to make a living."\n\n"There is not a man in this building who does not remember the collapse in the fifties. How it brought our enemies to our doorsteps and how it revealed the treachery of those we had once considered friends. Does Herr Erhard mean to bring the German economy to such a place of instability that it collapses again? When we consider the extent of Herr Erhard's plan today, we must think of one feature of any revolution, whether political or economic." Oberländer glanced around the room, noticing a furious Ludwig Erhard. "A revolution turns order on its head.""

 speerflavor.93.t: "Madness and Purges"
 speerflavor.93.desc: "Theodor Oberländer walked into his office to find it had been ripped apart. His pillows had been tossed aside and torn apart, as if someone expected them to contain some secrets. His drawers had been left half open, and there were papers scattered all over the room. And yet, there was not a person around to answer for it. His first thought was that someone had broken into his office, stolen something of importance or value. But who would be bold enough to rob the President of the Reichstag? He did not have to think long about the answer.\n\nOberländer turned, sprinting down the hall from the ransacked office. For all he knew, they were already looking for him. The building was emptier and quieter than Oberländer had ever remembered it being. The only sound present were his shoes against the floor. He rounded the corner, seeing that the door to what was once Heydrich's office had been left ajar. His lungs heaving the mad dash, he entered the room and closed the door behind him, making sure to lock it.\n\nA folder had been left open on Heydrich's desk. Neatly stenciled on the front, he knew, were the words "Theodor Oberländer". Oberländer picked through the files until he reached the end. On the final page were the words he himself had added on the day of Hitler's death. "Completely cleared of all suspicions regarding disloyalty to the Reich." To anyone else's eyes, it would have looked as if it was a memo Heydrich had written years before. Any papers proving otherwise had been rendered to ash and were now sitting in Oberländer's home wastebasket.\n\nA sense of weightlessness and total relief filled Oberländer. They had found nothing. Speer had found nothing for which the President of the Reichstag could be blamed, no matter how exhaustive his search had been. As Oberländer stood to leave, he heard the unmistakable sound of gunfire from outside the window. He had not been the only one."

 speerflavor.94.t: "An Odd Alliance"
 speerflavor.94.desc: "It was Kiesinger that Oberländer sought out. He was the only one of the reformists that seemed reasonable at times, and the President of the Reichstag figured that if any of Speer's clique were going to listen to him, it was Silver Tongue. He spotted the former lawyer, as always, in the process of schmoozing some unsuspecting policymaker, no doubt trying to curry his favor for some ludicrous proposal of Speer's in the future. It gave Oberländer an odd spurt of pleasure to be interrupting such a thing.\n\n"Deputy Führer," The President of the Reichstag intoned when the conversation seemed to have hit a lull. "We need to speak for a moment, if you are not too busy." Kiesinger shot an apologetic look at his companions and excused himself. The two men walked for a moment until they were properly out of any man's earshot. Kiesinger gave Oberländer an expectant look, waiting for the President to speak. "Is what I have heard true? Does Speer intend to dismantle IG Farben and the other corporations?"\n\n"Yes, and for good reason." Kiesinger wasted no time launching into a spiel. "President Oberländer, you are an educated man, even holding a doctorate in economics. You know how these corporations have crippled the German economy. These companies have destroyed the German labor industry. Their stranglehold on the markets is not just a travesty, but a crime. A crime against the Reich and the ideals of National Socialism. It is the duty of the Führer to stop such things."\n\nOberländer nodded. "There's no need to convince me, Deputy Führer. I hold the leeches on the German state in as much contempt as you do." That revelation seemed to have taken Kiesinger by surprise. "Herr Kiesinger, I simply came to offer my assistance to the Führer in this brave endeavor. This is a matter of concern for all of Germany, and as President of the Reichstag I throw my full support behind it." The rest of the conversation was much more productive."
 speerflavor.94.a: "The two shook hands and parted ways."

 speerflavor.95.t: "The Change to Come"
 speerflavor.95.desc: "Theodor Oberländer sat in a chair, facing the most powerful man in Europe. Albert Speer sat at a desk, facing a legislator who irritated him to his core. Neither man particularly liked his company. "My Führer," Oberländer began, boldly yet deferentially. "Surely you are not truly considering repealing the Nuremberg laws? The party would riot, and so would the corporations. Such a drastic action, so quickly after the war, seems to me somewhat unwise."\n\nSpeer eyed the President of the Reichstag. What was he getting at? "Herr Oberländer, I am sure you know where my support base is drawn from. The Nuremberg system of racial discrimination has done nothing but weaken the Reich." For years, Oberländer had been just as harshly critical of the Nuremberg laws as the reformers. Had he fully succumbed to the party line, just to spite Speer?\n\n"My Führer, you misunderstand. I do not propose that we continue the policy, only the laws behind it." Oberländer withdrew a folder, which he slid across the table to Speer. "Enclosed, my Führer, you will find several reports from myself on the heritage of the Eastern European population. At the time of the Nuremberg laws, these were widely considered Slavic, inferior peoples. However, this research has shown that a higher proportion than previously known is in fact of Nordic stock, and as such, of proper Aryan genealogy."\n\nSpeer nodded, suddenly understanding the President's suggestion. "If this report were to come to light, the Nuremberg laws may need to be taken under a period of review. During this period, of course, the persecution of Untermenschen will need to be temporarily halted, to ensure no Aryans are unwittingly harmed." Speer eyed the President of the Reichstag. Perhaps Oberländer was more crafty than Speer had given him credit for."
 speerflavor.95.a: "He must be watched closely."

 speerflavor.96.t: "Brothers of the Shadows"
 speerflavor.96.desc: "Theodor Oberländer did not know Reinhard Gehlen well, on a personal level, but he knew of him. The man had been well-known to have spies under every corner during the Second World War, and Oberländer guessed, by his appointment to the head of the Reich's new intelligence agencies, he had not curbed his activities in that field. He would serve as Speer's dagger in the dark, where the Gestapo had previously served as the NSDAP's club in the night. Oberländer was not stupid enough to not know what it meant.\n\nNow, a small metal dot had found its way to the bottom of Oberländer's desk, as he had been informed earlier that morning. Speer had failed to remove Oberländer during the purges, and now, it seemed, he was on Gehlen's list of people to watch closely. This attempt to have Oberländer killed was more subtle than the last one, but this time, Speer had failed to catch him unawares. And, Oberländer expected, he would continue to fail in later attempts.\n\nOne side effect of working in the Reich's intelligence programs was that one tended to trust their team with their life. It was odd, given how much of the profession was built around lying and mistrust. But if you could not act swiftly and unflinchingly based on the information of other agents, you were not in the correct profession. That level of trust, tested again and again, tended to build some sort of bond, even if the Reich tried their hardest to ensure friendships did not form.\n\nThose bonds, it seemed, were strong enough for Oberländer's old compatriots from the Abwehr to enlighten him of the RND's new plans for him. With a grimace, Oberländer pried loose the listening device, letting it fall to the ground. As the heel of his well polished shoe grinded the bug to dust, the President of the Reichstag considered sending a bouquet of flowers in thanks."

 speerflavor.97.t: "A Farewell"
 speerflavor.97.desc: ""Surely, there must be something that you can do to stop this, Oberländer." An indignant Schörner pressed the President of the Reichstag, who was becoming rather dissatisfied with the conversation. "You have the party's ear, the Reich's ear. If you call this injustice what it is, an injustice, then they will LISTEN to you!" He slammed his fist against the table, clearly in an expression of outrage. "They will be forced to listen to you, if they do not want the Reich's populace up in arms."\n\n"If you think that this is in any way my business, you are wrong, Herr Schörner." Oberländer carefully ran his hand over the part of the table that Schörner had hit, trying to be sure that he had not left a mark in it. The table had been a gift from his mother, and he did not want it ruined by a late-night visit from this ranting madman. "What sort of outrage would I invoke, informing the people that a military official had received a new assignment? And what would the outrage of the people, or the Reichstag accomplish, against the Führer's directives?"\n\nSchörner regarded the doctor with a look of undisguised disgust, flavored with the desperation of a starving man begging for scraps. "Oberländer, do you not see what Speer is doing? He is ridding himself of every competent and pure-minded member of the administration! He seeks to bastardize National Socialism, to bring about some Judeo-Liberal fantasy! You and I, we are the only ones who still command enough sway to stop him, before he ruins everything!" There was a look of hungry anger, something intensely frightening. "We cannot let him do this."\n\nAnd yet, Oberländer considered Schörner for a second. It seemed like madness, the bitter ramblings of a disgruntled general, and yet some of what he spoke rang true. Perhaps now was the time to make a stand, to make a move against Speer. Then, Oberländer noticed his wife peer into the room, wondering why Theodor had not yet returned to bed. Meeting her eyes, the President of the Reichstag rose. "Herr Schörner, I believe you have a train to catch." "

The president, usually one of the most boisterous voices in the Reichstag, watched quietly as the Reich's farce of a government bickered over what to do.\n\nSpeer had loosened the reins, and they had slipped from his hands. The slaves were revolting, just as dozens of party officials had expected. Speer, Kiesinger, Schmidt... They had given the Untermenschen the rope by which to hang the German nation. If they were to survive, if they were to continue... someone would have to do something.\n\nSomeone yelled for silence, and there was a clamor as the dissenting voices of the Reichstag eventually simmered down into silence. When all eyes turned to him and no one spoke, Oberländer realized that they were all expecting the President to address the assembly.\n\nFaced with the results of Speer's recklessness and searching for a solution, the Reichstag was looking to Oberländer."

Nevertheless, they seemed to be taken aback when he first proposed what he feared needed to be done.\n\n"Of course the slaves have been mishandled. Otherwise they would not be currently in armed revolt." After a moment's hesitation, Paul Wegener continued, his brows furrowing. "President Oberländer, are you suggesting a putsch against the Führer?"\n\n"Of course I'm not suggesting a putsch, Herr Wegener." Oberländer snapped. "We already have one revolt in the Reich, and to spark a second would only further damage Germany. I am suggesting that, if Speer fails in resolving his own mess, we ensure his carelessness is not the death of the Reich."\n\nHeinrich Trettner nodded along as the President spoke. "If even one mother loses a son because Speer felt the need to curry the favor of Untermenschen, I worry for the future of his Reich." He glanced over at Wegener, who still looked uncertain of the prospect. "Would this have happened under Hitler, Paul? I don't think it would have."\n\n"From the bottom of my heart, Herr Wegener, I hope that this revolt will prove insignificant, and that the slaves will become docile at the first rattling of a saber." Oberländer's face was a blank sheet, betraying nothing but grim determination. "But I fear that it will not, and that is an eventuality for which we must prepare.""

Thankfully, the laws of the Reich had meant that Oberländer had never dealt with much opposition in the Reichstag. It had seemed a blessing at the time, but it meant that he did not have as much experience in manufacturing back-door dealings as he would have liked.\n\nNow, however, the Reich was facing the biggest crisis since the West Russian War. The madmen had declared war on the slaves. It was exactly what the President feared. Oberländer was not certain what anyone with half a brain believed a thousand dead Germans and ten thousand martyred Untermenschen would achieve. It would certainly not bring about a great Reich. And thus, that goal was left up to Oberländer, Wegener, and Trettner.\n\nHermann Josef Abs, a massive man whom Oberländer had grown to despise the very look of, eyed the trio. "President Oberländer. Wegener here tells me that we have something to speak about?" Oberländer could imagine the disdain was mutual, even if Abs did not show it. The last time they had spoken, IG Farben was being ripped to bits by Speer... with Oberländer's help. "I'm a very busy man, and time is money, after all."\n\nOberländer hesitated, glancing at his associates, and Trettner gave him a nod. There was no going back now, even if this step was the most difficult of all to justify in Oberländer's head. The doctor turned back to Abs, who had begun to light a cigar. What an ass. "Herr Abs," Oberländer ventured, "How would you like to be the most powerful banker in the world once more?"\n\nHe liked the sound of it."

Immediately to his left, his close confidant Otto Ernst Remer. Next to him, the unfortunate consequence of having to compromise with the reactionary economic interests in the Reich which had made common cause in opposition to the liberals: IG Farben stooge Otto Ambros. A man far more to the liking of Schörner was Generalmajor Otto Wöhler, who had been forcefully retired by the traitorous liberals in Germania before Schörner rescued him. Last and in fact least amongst the cabinet ministers was Otto Abetz, in the now largely irrelevant role of representative to the Reich. Inspite of his irrelevance, Schörner still had a use for appearances, and so Abetz had to be kept around.\n\n"Very well Gentlemen." Schörner was interrupted by the sound of the cabinet room's door being opened, it was the chief of the intelligence for Heeresgruppe Russland, who had wisely joined him: Otto Wächter. Behind him, Otto Bradfisch, the liaison with Schörner's allies in Germany, closely followed. Reading all their names allowed while going through their reports, Schörner came to a stop. Something wasn't right, but he couldn't quite tell. After a brief pause, he continued to conduct the meeting, and only at its end realized what he was unsure about.\n\nOn his way back to Heeresgruppe Russland headquarters, he turned to his aide de camp, "

Far away, in the heart of Germania, he could see the snow-tipped Volkshalle, a behemoth towering over the city as an eternal reminder of National Socialism to its people. Disgust creeped up his throat.\n\nIn better circumstances, he would have found himself rallying the banner of the reformists. The shattered remnants of the NSDAP patched themselves together as the Speerite faction began winning over its contenders, and the will of the people was quashed under the liberal boot of Speer and his lackeys. Within a vacuum, their faction aligned with his goals. Without a vacuum, however, the truth was that he was alienated from them. He and Speer did not see eye-to-eye with each other, not at all, let alone his hand-picked and suspicious ministers, most especially that Ludwig Erhard and Helmut Schmidt. Their beliefs were intolerable.\n\nSo he found himself aligning with the remnants of the NSDAP before the war. The hardliners, the orthodox National Socialists, people obsessed with the picture painted by the triumphs of Germany before its series of catastrophes began. As Oberländer looked away from the Volkshalle and began moving towards his car, he scowled to himself, his footsteps filling the emptiness of the street, alongside his own thoughts. The hardliners were deluded if they thought that things could simply go back to normal like it was in the 30s and 40s, and while he found little interest in their beliefs, he did find much interest in their usefulness.\n\nIt was not an alliance born out of sympathetic causes, no, not at all. But there was no other option. The click of the car door and the roll of warmth coming from inside invited Oberländer in, and he slammed it shut behind him as he entered, key turning and engine revving as he gave one last glance towards Speer's show of ego.\n\nThe fools in his party and the madmen following Speer waited for his first move."

He had been so lulled into staring up towards the night sky, eyes piercing through the rolling clouds of fog, tracing one constellation and another, drawing his mind away from what was real, factual, and horrifying.\n\nAll it took was one bullet for him to be sent here. To Berchtesgaden. To this resort home that Hitler had built for him. A gift from decades ago from a man who felt, in this moment, barely responsive to Speer's memories. Schmidt had twisted this gift from him like a knife in a wound when he was told to come here and "de-stress". As if. That spineless coward hid behind a sorrowful frown and hid the fear he felt from Speer, all the while pretending what had happened had never happened. That-\n\nHe felt his fist impact the wooden railing, irritation trailing across the side of his palm and finger, and he didn't even bother to look up as he continued to stare longingly towards the stars and the mountains, the thick blankets of a white smokey haze providing a strange sense of comfort. It reminded Speer of the ambitions he had before coming into politics - a simple job, a simple pursuit, and a simple end, but the world could never be so predictable and so easy. Destiny, if it even existed, had other plans for him.\n\nHis shoulders ached and his body was irritable, but Speer stayed put regardless. He could have stared into the great world beyond him for hours and hours, marvelling in its excellence, even if it was a tiny fragment of what encompassed the planet. But he couldn't deny that a tight feeling in his chest formed the more time that had passed, and at some point he could feel it breathe in and out irregularly. As beautiful as the world was in front of him, untarnished by war, untouched by petty politics, he knew he had taken a plunge into darkness."

 speerflavor.104.t: "Letter of Penance"
 speerflavor.104.desc: ""I should have you shot, dog!"\n\nThe uncommon spark of fury within Speer's voice only prompted a smile from Schörner, who felt pain shoot through his back as he was slammed against the wall by two Orpo agents, cold concrete running across the length of his thin coat. Speer, meanwhile, stood two meters away, carrying with him a loaded pistol, as well as a menacing glare in his gaze. "You are one of the worst traitors to the Reich, and by all accounts, I should have you executed here and now!" He continued, pulling back the hammer of the gun as Schörner could see the round, smooth black of the barrel pointing down at him.\n\nThe silence that came from Schörner emphasized the small cough he gave afterwards, ringing insultingly throughout the bland and empty room, and he felt the sun flood his neck with warmth as he craned his head up to look at Speer. "Well, then, go on." He said, lips parting to reveal a small, victorious grin. "Kill me. Start another civil war. I am certain the militarists will accept whatever judgement you pass." The burning sarcasm tightened Speer's grip on the pistol, and a finger itched to slip into the trigger zone - yet didn't. "Perhaps you can even quarter and draw me. Then they would cheer, wouldn't they?" A defiant gaze followed a sudden sharper and louder tone. "Wouldn't they, Herr Speer?"\n\nSpeer grimaced so hard he felt like his teeth would shatter. In a moment of anger, a tired hand swung cold steel towards Schörner's head, slamming him and leaving a heavy bruise on the grinning man's face. "Release him!" Speer ordered, and Schörner felt his limbs lighten. "And get the Hell out of my sight. I don't want to look at you until things stabilize."\n\nBlood pooled from the cut inside his cheek, and Schörner spat, staining Speer's shirt with red."

But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. My punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.\n\nI am inside my head again. I turn to the minister reading his notes, not that I can remember his name. He was saying something about death warrants. I'll probably have to sign them later. No doubt it would be someone I knew of, someone with too many good ideas making too much noise. I'd attended meetings like this in Hitler's day, and I didn't care for them then. I don't care now, though not for the same reason. Back then I was too busy daydreaming of plans of buildings unbuilt.\n\nI know I am daydreaming now, but again for a different reason. People believed in me, but who am I? An architect? A warlord? A dictator? All these and more. I have made excuses every day, pretended to myself he did not see, I did not know, but I knew what was going on and did not care. Rise higher, throw more people beneath your boots, then perhaps you can make a change. Then my ego had taken over - why am I surrounded by killers, by liars, by men of such arrogance? Surely I can do better in these trying times than these lunatics? Now I am Hitler, and I seem to be the only one who knows.\n\nI recall the first time I had witnessed a speech from that paradoxical man. I had expected swastikas, brown shirts, roaring and demagoguery. I had been met by the opposite - a man in an inexpensive suit sharing his worries about his country he loved. He had mentioned the Jews of course, but only in passing, a menace of bankers rather than blood. Goebbels had been different, a frothing mess, a roaring croud, a repulsive spectacle. Yet still I joined. I was not choosing the NSDAP but becoming a follower of Hitler, I told myself. He had taken hold of me before I grasped what was happening, I believed for many years.

Pure, unfettered pride. Now they would all be forced to deal with his unique management style.\n\nAlbert examined the agenda. Expansion of Wehrmacht funding. Increased recruitment efforts. Military research and development budget tripled. Preferential contracts to IG Farben, Daimler-Benz, Reichswerke, the old guard. Unrepentant reaction to his recent reforms. He sighed, leaned back in his chair, and prepared for a long opening speech."

speer_natsoc.13.t:0 "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"
speer_natsoc.13.d:0 "Albert certainly appreciated the aesthetic of excess - that much could be gleaned from studying any of his buildings. Still, all things must have a function, and he was hard pressed to find the function of this place. The Reich had invested a great deal into nuclear power, but this plant produced practically none. Still the reactor thrummed away, atoms crashing and splitting with one end product - Plutonium. They had accumulated Uranium aplenty from their conquests in Russia and Africa, but that volatile and vital component in nuclear weapons was needed now more than ever - or so he was told.\n\nFissile material production had ramped up in response to the Reich's recent demand that their weapons stockpile be doubled in size, to appropriately operate as a deterrent. Speer did not see the difference - one city killing bomb will kill as many as a hundred if there are no more cities to be found. To his new ministers it seemed an economic stimulus, allowing for great expansion within those old, proud companies that dominated heavy industry and big science. To Schörner it was another opportunity to swing his weight and make room for himself. To him, it was a waste. There would be no economic recovery if there were no people to recover it. And if Schörner got his way, there would be all the room in the world."

speer_natsoc.14.t:0 "Higher than the Alps"
speer_natsoc.14.d:0 "It had been a long time since Albert had been to Austria. Bormann had rather spoiled the atmosphere in the Berghof with his tasteless redecorating, and Albert had been more focused on his own projects than renovating yet another of Hitler's houses. Still, the state visits never ended, and it wasn't like there was much outside the Reich to visit any more. This was admittedly one of the better views he'd seen on his travels, however.\n\nThe crunch of boots on snow was outlining the figures the officer offered him. How the hell they hauled this many tanks up here he'd never know. The normally stark white slopes of the alps seemed carpeted in Feldgrau, tents beyond number. On the higher slopes he noted mortar positions, subtle dots of sniper nests, flak cannons ready to repel any plane that dared to stray too close to the gun-toting obelisk they inhabited. Unfortunately for Albert it had been a bumpy ride in a truck with some stern-faced Fallschirmjagers followed by a hike that had left his knees weak - no helicopter could reach this rarefied level of air.\n\nHe waved his hand at his binocular-toting secretary, and raised the pair to his eyes. The Italians too occupied a spot in the clouds, scant kilometres away across tank traps, minefields, Czech hedgehogs and enough barbed wire to enclose Ost-Paris. He'd seen the reports, things were escalating here. More equipment, more men, bigger plans, the OKW had demanded it all and got it. He just prayed there would be no spark to light the fuse."

speer_natsoc.15.t:0 "Another Runner in the Night"
speer_natsoc.15.d:0 "He should have seen it coming, in hindsight. The gang of reformists that he had gathered around himself, so often attempting to assert their own will in place of his own ceasing their bleating for one blessed moment? He had welcomed it. He wasn't quite sure what the final straw had been, there seemed to have been so much debate between them all in the smoky halls of the Volkshalle. All he knew was that when their respective secretaries made their morning calls, Herren Kiesinger, Erhard, Schmidt, and their families were not there. They had searched, naturally, and found themselves at the end of a trail that had could have been years in the planning, one last ratline in the event they didn't get their way.\n\nHe had raged, at first. It was a rare time he let his temper get the better of him, but that night was the first in a month of furious tantrums; against that Gang of Three with their conspiracies; against the Reich he had worked so hard to fix crumbling before his eyes; at himself. Most of all, however, he was afraid. He could feel the sharks circling. There were other, less enlightened members of the party that believed themselves more suitable for the task than he - and he was too dangerous to be left alive.\n\nHe was wrong. Oberländer had neutered him, shoved his hand up his arse and was now controlling him like a ventriloquist's dummy. No more allies meant no more Speer. Now the ones alive were likely sunning themselves in America - all too eager to leave their Reich behind."
speer_natsoc.15.a:0 "We remain."

speer_natsoc.16.t:0 "Damnatio Memoriae"
speer_natsoc.16.d:0 "It is all too easy to forget a person ever existed. We are only so much as the mark that we leave on this world, Albert reflected from his living room. Margarete was out somewhere, not that they paid one another much attention these days. It was all too easy to simply spend the evening gazing into the fire, flick a piece of paper in and watch it wither and curl. He had almost forgotten his book.\n\nIt didn't do to have traitors in the former ranks of such esteemed men as his current cabinet, so they had been removed. Every piece of paper they had signed was redacted. Every law they signed could be repealed, for it was a sabotage. Even their homes had been demolished, and mention of their names had been forbidden from any form of media. It didn't bear saying what had happened to their housekeeping staff.\n\nIn America no doubt they would be telling tales of the daring snub to the Reich, but here no news of their escape would ever run. People might ask what had happened to the ministers, but they would never get an answer - and eventually they would reach their own conclusions. He returned to his book."
speer_natsoc.16.a:0 "Who the hell was Herostratus?"

speer_natsoc.17.t:0 "The Speer Defense"
speer_natsoc.17.d:0 "It's easy to blame something on someone who isn't there. Like a fart in an elevator, blame belongs to whoever left last. Therefore the logical thing to do was to blame every problem on their recent departures.\n\nThere was an economic downtown? It wasn't me.\nTurn your information over? It wasn't me.\nOur government is losing power? It wasn't me.\nInstall security cameras? It wasn't me.\n\nIndeed, to the party it had seemed like there was all too little Albert had done. It was only natural someone else would take the reins, if only as a guiding hand. It seems denying culpability only gets you so far. The propaganda continued however - the Gang of Four had been spies, infiltrators of the highest order. Perhaps in a way it was true. It had certainly been a blunder of the highest order."
speer_natsoc.17.a:0 "책임을 떠넘기는 것이 받아들이는 것 보다 더 쉽지."

speer_natsoc.18.t:0 "I'm Just a Soul Whose Intentions are Good"
speer_natsoc.18.d:0 "Collective responsibility had been something he had taken very seriously while he still had some weight to throw around - while the Führer made the decision, everyone agreed it was the best decision. As such, all the awful, treasonous ideas of that clique of traitors would be collectively agreed to be eliminated - only this time, the shoe was on the other foot. It was his own ministers so eagerly dictating the removal of their predecessors' ideas. While Albert agreed with a few of these in principal, he most certainly disagreed with the gusto with which "his" ministers went about their business without consulting him.\n\nSpeer had always done his best to portray himself as the benevolent type of dictator, but that was becoming all the more difficult when his ministers' approach had shifted from velvet glove to iron gauntlet. The people had liked his new breed of more civil ministers, especially the students who had put him in this building in the first place. But god, if he didn't miss their bickering. He was certainly reminded of it enough by the pile of documents he had to plough through to eliminate their subversive influence.\n\nAnother law revoked - stamp. Another plan cancelled - stamp. Another protection removed - stamp."
speer_natsoc.18.a:0 "Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood."

speer_natsoc.19.t:0 "키징어와 커피 한 잔"
speer_natsoc.19.d:0 "Naturally his subversive former friends were being monitored closely. Once the Reich's sharpest men had been made aware the trail existed they reached the other end with a mere hop of the Atlantic. Albert had contemplated having them eliminated, but decided against it. The open murder of former government officials claiming asylum was too brazen by half. They were instead watched from a distance, and Albert received reports on their activities every single day.\n\nHe recalled the mornings he had spent with Kiesinger, a cup of coffee and a sharp debate. Kurt had always been the easiest of them to deal with, the most realistic. Those talks had been spirited, but had never exasperated him nearly as much as that windbag Erhard. He had always seemed to have the right words to get what he wanted, and Speer would observe him running circles around him just as often as the other two.\n\nAlbert sipped his coffee and flicked through the report. Kiesinger had been talking to the Americans of course, who knew how long for. Every day he met with CIA agents, who were presumably digging for every scrap of information about Speer and his new government. Kurt would have them hanging on his every word for as long as he desired."
speer_natsoc.19.a:0 "It always was his talent."

speer_natsoc.20.t:0 "슈미트와 담배 한 대"
speer_natsoc.20.d:0 "Schmidt was confusing. He had been deferential, polite, capable. At first, his only flaw had been the smoking. They'd actually had to increase the cleaning budget to deal with the buildup on the ceilings. But as time went on, something beneath was revealed. Schmidt did not like many of the people he worked with. He did not like many of the policies his government had. He seemed to dislike the Reich as an institution.\n\nNow of course, Speer knew that was exactly the case. Schmidt was a subversive, probably in league with Reichsbanner before he was forced to make his escape. While Erhard maintained himself by mooching off the economists of his host nation and Kiesinger was feeding the government information on a slow drip, Schmidt was openly denouncing his birth country, writing his tell-all memoirs. The informants in his household had managed to acquire a photograph of a page for his perusal. "Inside the Third Reich" was a uniquely unflattering picture of Speer and his management, and alluded to many things Albert would have rather kept under wraps."

speer_natsoc.21.d:0 "에르하르트는 그들 중 가장 성가신 존재였다. 괴링 처럼 자리를 차지했고, 비스마르크 처럼 말하며, 망할 굴뚝처럼 담배를 피워댔다. 확실히 슈페어의 경제 운용은 기적적인 것과는 거리가 멀었지만, 에르하르트가 그걸 뿌리째 뽑아야 한다는 듯이 말하는 모습은 그의 피를 끓게 했다. 에르하르트는 이제 자신의 기적적인 경제체계의 미덕이 독일의 문제점으로 부터 독일을 실제로든 생각속에서든 구했을 것이라고 찬양하고 있었다. \n\n미국인들은 그 소리를 주워먹고 있었다. 그의 통찰력은 수십 년 동안 독일 체제를 가장 잘 살펴본 것 중 하나로 묘사되었고, 그는 "대륙계 스타일" 경제학자들로 구성된 자신의 파벌을 얻은 것이 분명했다. 끝없이 반대할거라면 하라지. 적어도 슈페어는 마침내 창문을 열지 않고 회의를 끝낼 수 있었다."

Rome defined itself by the mediterranean, their 'Mare Nostrum', while China, Portugal and Holland capitalised on spice flows to a greedy West. Humanity's first nations followed a similar origin point. Along the Indus, Yellow and Nile rivers, civilizations rose on the backs of boats carrying the boons of the agricultural revolution upstream and downstream. Preceding the building of any man's home is the greasing of palms, or a suitable means to begin doing so.\n\nModern nations follow the same principles. That's why, before the gun, a wise statesman has always picked the embargo; more discrete and far more vicious than it's lethal counterpart. Smith's prediction of a globalised economy has only assisted this balance further. One can defeat a breadless enemy before a single shot is fired.\n\nAll war must end, however, and today the economic war that the Reich and the United States have fought for decades is closing. The embargo has been lifted, and the lungs of the dormant commercial titan of the Hanseatic can breathe once more. Industrial works in the Ruhr bellow with a rejuvenated spirit, and the Germania Stock Exchange is entering what the American's call a 'bull market'. Both the Führer and the President have given optimistic speeches, celebratory words delivered from the Volkshalle and the White House, while their foreign ministries conclude business and return home in a better world.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise on an Atlantic at rest, with once bitter enemies shaking hands. In war, there are no winners, and in this peace history would seem to have produced two."

"You're saying there's a rebellion on?"\n\n"I'm not saying there's a rebellion, there IS a rebellion! They're all over the place!" The diplomat's voice crackled over the radio, the rattle of rifle fire occasionally making its way into the receiver. The fire was rapid, fast, and seemingly close. Helmut shifted as a mental picture began to form in his head.\n\n"So it's another slave rebellion. Well, shit, do what we did with the last one." He muttered into the phone, a hint of confusion mixing into his normal stately tone.\n\n"No, Helmut, you don't understand. This isn't some slave revolt. The whole fucking city is up in arms! They've got Reichsbanner flags, they're chanting-"\n\n"Reichsbanner?" A shot of excitement fired up Schmidt's spine, quickly followed by fear. This was simultaneously very good and very bad. "Shit, are you sure?"\n\n"We can't put this down! They've got guns, they've got ammo, I think they've stolen a few tanks- oh, shit!" The screeching of metal faintly pulsed through the receiver, quickly accompanied by the roaring of an angry crowd. "Fuck, ok, I've got to go. We're evacuating. Warschau is lost, repeat, Warschau is lost!" The line went dead with a slam.\n\nHelmut stood in disbelief, still glued to the phone. Finally, after a moment of silence, he dropped the receiver and rushed to the train station. This was going to be big."

speer_slaverevolt.2.desc:0 "Speer had never seen the council assemble so quickly before. Speidel, Schmidt, Kiesinger, Erhard, Tresckow- he could tell that each of them had rushed here on short notice. Their reactions were similarly varied- Speidel's calm exterior was betrayed by his deeply furrowed brow, Erhard and Tresckow both seemed worried, Kiesinger showed only mild interest, and Schmidt seemed to be almost excited at the thought. Speer regarded him with an extra stare before beginning. "So, give me a rundown."\n\n"Well, my Fuhrer-" Speidel began, but was quickly cut off by Schmidt's quick talking.\n\n"My Fuhrer, the Poles of Warschau have risen up, aided by the Reichsbanner. Apparently, this "Spartakus" has made his presence known there, and they're setting up for a potential counterattack. The Polish government is in disarray- they're trying to set up a new government, but they're not having a good time of it. The rebels have gone about freeing the slaves, lifting the Nuremberg laws, repealing restrictions-"\n\n"Why are you so excited about this, Helmut? They're fucking it all up! I've done so damn much for them and this is how they repay me? I don't know why I ever listened to any of you if all you do is give me problems!" Speer shouted, slamming his fist into the table. Schmidt recoiled, as did the rest of the gang- this was new.\n\nThe sudden silence was broken by the entrance of the secretary, delivering a new report to the Fuhrer. He read it, reread it, and then threw it in the air with a resounding "FUCK!""

That's all he's been doing for the entire time I've worked with him."\n\nKiesinger sighed. Perhaps he should have expected this- Speer's revolt to the slave siege some time ago hadn't exactly been a reasoned one. "In any case, my Fuhrer, we can't truly have an effective response until we know how far this is going to spread. It'll do us no good to try and put out these fires while more are picking up."\n\n"Why don't you look yourself, Kiesinger? Here we are, with our plans unravelling before us, with everything the conservatives said would happen coming true, and you're all standing around here preaching the merits of the Reichsbanner? Hell, Schmidt's been basically on their side since he got here!" Speer snapped.\n\n"I never said I was in support of the slaves." Schmidt responded. Speer turned to him with an incredulous look.\n\n"Bullshit. You think I'm dumb, Helmut? I can see it on your face. You've been waiting for this for years." Schmidt opened his mouth to respond, but Kiesinger waved him off.\n\n"In any case, my Fuhrer, we must wait until the cards fall. This is certain to get worse before it gets better." Kiesinger stated. As if to prove his point, the secretary returned, bearing more bad news. Speer groaned as he read it- before, at least it was confined to Poland. Now this was going to be a total mess."

Reports of isolated uprisings in factories, slave mobs arming themselves in the rebel holdouts, the occasional gunbattles with police and soldiers, and the slow consolidation of the rebels into an organized army. Every report that came in angered Speer even more, and only hardened his resolve against the other four men in this room.\n\nWhat a fool he was to trust them! Every step of the way, they had subverted his requests and gone against his orders. They had forced him, over and over, to agree with them and avoid collapse. Ever since he had brought them on, they had made his job harder than it ever had to be. And now, at the hour of Germany's greatest danger since World War II, here they were to subvert him again, poisoning his ideals and dragging Germany away from what made it such a power to start with.\n\nHe wouldn't take any more of it, he decided. From here on in, he would call the shots, not some petty idealists or fat capitalist or some old military man. As the report of the next city to fall- Minsk- came in, he made up his mind. Now was the time to really show who the true power in Germany was- him, Albert Speer."

speer_slaverevolt.5.t:0 "Nowhere Is Safe"
speer_slaverevolt.5.desc:0 "As reports continued to roll in of spontaneous rebellions, clear trends began to emerge from the haze. Speer reviewed them and pieced them together, a master architect building his latest work- not one of stone or steel, but one of statitistics. The cities that had revolted so far all fit the same few categories. Kiew, Warschau, Minsk, Krakow- all were poor, eastern cities. None had been successfully Germanized. Each still had significant amounts of slaves, whether personal or company owned. Finally, the major kicker- each had abnomally high levels of Reichsbanner activity. Perhaps it was the relatively young demographics of each city, or perhaps it was the universities, but the pattern was clear. A plan formed in Speer's head- this was still controllable. With the right analysis and the right plan, he could stop this rebellion in its tracks.\n\nAnd then a revolt seized Riga, and the statistics crumbled away.\n\nRiga shared none of these tells with the other cities, besides a high slave population. It held a significant German minority. It was rich, even after the chaos that had engulfed Ostland years ago. It had not even had a major Reichsbanner presence. Yet, here it was, another angry red mark of revolt splintering the Reich. Speer put the paper down on his desk to join the pile, sighed, and tore the rest of his analysis off the corkboard. Perhaps there was no pattern to this. Perhaps there was no stopping it."

speer_slaverevolt.6.t:0 "Tidal Wave"
speer_slaverevolt.6.desc:0 "There had been one saving grace to the Slave Revolt- its adherence to the cities. Each revolt was confined merely to the city- painful, but containable. The Heer, mobilized to action by the Fuhrer's personal order, sat in siege around the city, a complicated standoff ensuing between the slaves and the soldiers- neither side willing to fire first. As long as the revolt stayed inside the urban jungle, the Reich still stood.\n\nOf course, it didn't.\n\nSomehow, someway, the news spread to the slave plantations that still toiled in the countryside. One by one, the slaves found their spines, taking up arms against their masters and burning their fields to the ground. Mobs met each other and became armies, tearing through the countryside and burning any slaveowning home they found. Soon enough, the Wehrmacht found itself flanked, and, humiliatingly, was forced to retreat as the country slaves jubilously met with the students and rebels of the cities.\n\nAs the mood out east turned joyous, the mood in the Fuhrer's office darkened. Speer slammed his fist into his table, barely suppressing a angry yell. This was all that rat bastard gang's fault. They had played with fire, and now the whole Reich would burn."

speer_slaverevolt.7.desc:0 "Despite its relative calm compared to other Reichskommissariate, it seems Moskowien hasn't been spared from the chaos of the slave revolt. While indentured servants in the former Russian lands are far less than across the rest of the Reich, they still make up a considerable number, and it seems that the general chaos gripping the entire German colonial empire has emboldened them.\n\nAll across the Reichskommissariat, tens of thousands of slaves break their chains and assault the German garrisons overseeing their suffering, taking their weapons and establishing pockets of resistance in the Russian plains. They ask for freedom, and most of them are ready to fight to the death rather than kneel once more. If they are to die - this is the message relayed to the Reichskommissar - they will die as free men.\n\nEven though their numbers swell with every passing day, and local authorities struggle to protect the cities from the increasing wave of dissent, it seems that - unlike the metropolitan Reich - reaction is mounting. Reports tell of German regular forces regrouping under the leadership of Feldmarschall Schörner, and preparing for a counter-offensive: the general has sworn to return order to the Russian Reichskommissariat, "no matter the cost""

speer_slaverevolt.8.t:0 "So Falls Moskowien"
speer_slaverevolt.8.desc:0 "The eerie silence of the corridor was interrupted by the sharp clicking of boots against the polished floor. The men strode onwards with purpose, their overcoats fluttering behind them. They pushed through the door at the end of the corridor and marched up the crimson stairs, stepping around the crumpled bodies that punctuated every turn. When the gang reached the top, an armed officer saw them approach and thrust his hand into the air.\n\n"Heil Schörner!"\n\nFerdinand Schörner saluted in response. The traces of a smile were tugging at his lips, threatening to ruin his forcefully stern expression as he marched his men towards the cabinet room. At last, Moskau was his. Moskowien was his. The coup has been an absolute success, although naturally he had not been there to witness it.\n\nAnyone who dared resist the militarist infiltration of Moskau's government buildings – from the lowliest secretaries and guards to the highest politicians and generals – were shot on site. The rest were in the process of being deported to KZ like the traitors they were.\n\nThe men entered the cabinet room. Blood was splattered across the framed portraits that hung on the walls. Remer took a seat at the far end of the table and began speaking in a mockingly reedy voice, replicating Alexis von Roenne's mannerisms perfectly. The militarists cackled with laughter. A gunshot rang out somewhere on the floor below them.\n\nThe Reich cried out for a savior as the waves of treason threatened to drown it forever, and Schörner answered the call. A thin smile finally spread across his face. How long until his men were storming Germania and dragging the liberal rats out of the Reichstag by their ties?"
speer_slaverevolt.8.a:0 "Just how grand are this madman's ambitions?"

speer_slaverevolt.9.t:0 "Schörner In Control"
speer_slaverevolt.9.desc:0 "The report sat among what seemed like a million others on Speer's desk, the rest of the gang crowded in their various chairs. However, this one was clearly more important than any other- the Fuhrer had even cleared out a space on his desk for it, an island of paper on a sea of hardwood. He looked up at the gang and placed a finger squarely on the text. "You want to know what this says?"\n\nSilence. Ashamed, total silence. No gang member even dared to stare into Speer's flaming eyes.\n\n"'Feldmarschall Schörner has, after his coup in Moskowien, seized control of revolting areas through swift, forceful action. From the little information we are currently receiving, Reichsbanner rebels have either retreated into hiding or fled." Speer read, matter of factly. He looked up again when he finished. Still, none of the others dared to respond. "You know what this means? It means that Ferdinand fucking Schörner is the Reich's face of stability and action, and we're standing around with our pants down!"\n\n"Well, my Fuhrer, Schörner has the luxury to just run over protestors with tanks-" Schmidt started. Speer cut him off with a furious wave of his hand.\n\n"And why can't we do the same? They're the rebels. If the American students started shooting at their soldiers, they wouldn't pussyfoot around with their response, would they?"\n\nSilence- a stunned, disbelieving silence- entered the room. Slowly, the gang filed out, and Speer sat back down. That was certainly too far, but was it not a justified outburst? If Germania didn't do something and fast, Schörner would do it for them, and then they'd be in real trouble."

speer_slaverevolt.10.desc:0 "Without reinforcement from Germania, itself facing a growing wave of unrest, today the German garrison in Warsaw has evacuated the city in full haste. Aided by the Polish resistance, thousands of freed indentured laborers assaulted isolated barracks, police stations and other strategic locations all across central Poland, arming themselves with anything they could find: unprepared for an uprising of this magnitude, the German forces found themselves scattered and easy prey for partisans and enraged slaves.\n\nWith the central government unable to answer due to the mainland having the exact same problems, - only a hundred times worse - central Poland is effectively no-man's land. Bands of slaves roam the countryside and the cities, but without a unified leadership they act as they please: some merely try to return home, while others sack houses and stores, attacking all German settlers in sight."

speer_slaverevolt.11.t:0 "Slaves Take Control Of Galicia!"
speer_slaverevolt.11.desc:0 "As the slave revolt expands, Poland finds itself more and more in chaos. With central Poland devoid of any authority, Galicia was doomed to be the next, and as soon as the first news about unrest in the camps came to the garrison, its commanding officers were faced with a difficult choice: either evacuate as much personnel and equipment as possible, or try to crush the revolt in blood. Under the current circumstances, the first choice was preferred, though it is unknown whether the decision was motivated by humanity or lack of means.\n\nWith the German garrison gone, and the central government still reeling from the magnitude of what's happening, very few believe that the Reich will try to reclaim Galicia soon. Thousands of Russian and Ukrainian slaves roam the region, some of them moving East trying to find a way home, while others take advantage of the lack of security to exact their vengeance upon those unlucky enough to have been left behind."

speer_slaverevolt.12.desc:0 "With Poland almost entirely occupied by the slaves, Ukraine found itself cut off from support coming from the mainland. As expected, the news of the ongoing revolt spread quickly among the indentured assets in the camps and factories, and soon unrest soared above what the security forces could cope: after uselessly trying to contain the wave of strikes and armed assaults, the Ukrainian authorities have ordered all military and administrative personnel to evacuate towards the East.\n\nWhile the reports of German settlers overloading ships in Crimea and fleeing towards Turkey are dismissed by the government as nonsense, there are no doubts about the seriousness of the situation. Should the Reich fail to restore order, the revolt may overwhelm Kiev and Eastern Ukraine, and in such case, German control over Eastern Europe will soon collapse."

speer_slaverevolt.13.desc:0 "With the fall of Poland to the slave revolt, and Ukraine is chaos, it was only a matter of time before the unrest spilled across the Vistula and up towards the North. While the German military managed to secure the lands directly bordering Eastern Prussia, they couldn't stray too far from the metropolitan Reich due to the risk of overextension: Letgallen was just outside the reach of the Wehrmacht, and local authorities barely had the time to evacuate to the military-controlled areas before the entire region was overrun by slave revolts.\n\nThe loss of this strategic region East of Riga opens the way for the revolt to reach the rest of the former Baltic Republics, where the recent civil war following the collapse Reichskommissariat Ostland has left many scars, some of which still aren't healed. The central government has started to debate the best solution to fight the uprising, but unless drastic measures are taken immediately, the situation will most likely continue, and infect even more regions."

speer_slaverevolt.14.desc:0 "With the last of the German garrison evacuated from Reval, Estonia is now officially lost to the Reich. When Latgale fell only a few days ago, the authorities had immediately begun preparations, requisitioning civilian ships docked at the port and loading them with documents, equipment and as many German civilians as possible: when the border patrols reported slave bands crossing the border of the administrative region, and unrest mounting in Reval itself, the evacuation began in earnest, and the enslaved laborers were freed mostly bloodlessly.\n\nEven though there haven't been episodes of violence against the German settlers yet, aerial reconnaissance missions show several armouries and police stations on fire, likely burned after all remaining weapons had been ransacked. With the Baltic region under rebel control, the Reich can no longer reinforce Belarus by land, which makes it the perfect candidate for the next stage of the uprising."

Slave camps and factories near Vitebsk erupted in violence almost at the same time, showing a degree of coordination unseen in other regions touched by the uprising: the security guards were either killed or forced to flee, and most of the administrative personnel was forced to flee overnight towards Moskowien, leaving precious supplies and documents in rebel hands.\n\nStill remembering the atrocities of the Ostland civil war, bands of slaves attacked both German settlers and Belarusian collaborators, with lynch mobs burning government buildings and police stations and sacking houses and stores owned by people connected to the German rule.

Weapons had been smuggled inside the labor camps around Minsk, and when night fell, the revolt erupted, taking the security by surprise: many were killed, and those who survived could only escape to the city and warn the administration. With barely enough time to gather their families, the officials were hurriedly evacuated alongside most of the garrison.\n\nWith the fall of Minsk, one of the main centers of German administration in Eastern Europe, the chain of command is quickly coming apart as the remaining minor administrations desperately try to save themselves from what is felt more and more like a looming doom. With most of the German Lebensraum lost, reports from the central government relay the worry over the dramatic increase of unrest in Germany itself."

Kiew, the main settlement in Ukraine, and largest industrial centre in the region, has fallen during the night as thousands of indentured laborers managed to free themselves and attacked the guards: the garrison desperately tried to hold the city, but they were only a few hundreds against tens of thousands. Faced with the prospect of having to fight to the death against a human wave, or call the Luftwaffe and burn the city to ashes to keep order, the commander chose retreat.\n\nWithin a few hours, the government and their families were evacuated to Crimea in a heavily-escorted convoy, immediately followed by most remaining German forces and all those who feared for their lives. Without a functioning administration, order across Ukraine is collapsing: while the revolt is yet to hit the Eastern part of the country, the Reich fears it will touch the Caucasus, one of the regions with the highest percentage of slaves in the entire Reich."

For the gang, it was when Speer's fiery outbursts cooled to a slow burning, controlled anger. For the people, it was when the news reports began to talk about how the Heer was "containing" the unrest. For Schorner, it was when his men stopped reporting casualty numbers from skirmishes with the Reichsbanner.\n\nYes, it was a peace- a shaky one, built only on the unwillingness of Germany to attack, but a peace. Soldiers on both sides dug in, from the forests of Lithuania to the fields of Ukraine. The Reichsbanner's rebellion had torn the Reich in half, literally- one half dominated by Schorner and his militarists, undoubtedly plotting for the final blow against Speer and his reformism. The other half digging in, trying to find some way to end the crisis before the winds of revolution spread further. Between them, a red strip of land, dominated by idealists, slaves, and students.\n\nIt was a powderkeg waiting to blow, but for now, the spark was not yet lit.

The oil fields in Machatschkala, despite being smaller than the ones in Aserbaidschan, are still very extensive, employing thousands of slaves to extract their black gold: during the night, rebels set the oil rigs on fire and attacked the security forces while they tried to extinguish the flames; with their stolen equipment, they attacked in great numbers military roadblocks and outposts, finally forcing a general retreat towards the South.\n\nWith Ostkaukasus lost, Baku is now completely isolated from the Reich, and kept afloat only through an air bridge linking its airport with Eastern Prussia. In this chaotic situation, worrying reports are filtering: they talk about hundreds of mercenaries reaching Aserbaidschan from Moskowien and by airplane, paid for by the corporations and led by a former SS-turned-mercenary called Otto Weidinger. These private soldiers are slowly forcing themselves inside the administration the more the garrison loses ground: if the central government doesn't act soon, they might soon be the only ones keeping order in the region..."

The city was evacuated soon after.\n\nAs the local administration and the remaining soldiers flee towards Moskowien to find refuge, the government in Germania reels from the hit. Now, almost all of Ukraine has fallen, with only the Southern part of the Reichsland under German control: as the security forces strengthen their defences, they can only prepare for what is perceived more and more as an imminent doom."

When the first uprisings began in the countryside, and smaller cells became active in the city itself, all valuable assets were evacuated by ship to Crimea, where the administration is trying to reorganize and resist.\n\nAs communications struggle to come to and from Germania, the situation grows even more difficult. If decisive action isn't taken immediately, the last of Ukraine may soon fall, and even the heavily-Germanized parts of the country are in danger: already barricades and trenches dot the Dnepr, manned by survivors from the garrison and local militias hastily risen from the population fearing violence from the slaves."

The Kriegsmarine patrols the coast in force, and the naval command of Theodericstadt has deployed elite marine detachments at key locations in the city: all guns and rifles are ready to open fire upon anyone foolish enough to threaten their home base, armed or not.

While most had thought these men were only paid by the corporations to protect the vital oil fields in the region, their presence had soon taken a more sinister meaning: day after day, the mercenaries and their enigmatic leader, a former SS-turned-mercenary named Otto Weidinger, took more and more power within the crumbling administration, taking advantage of the growing chaos to present themselves as the only ones with the means to protect Germany's interests.\n\nToday, in a shocking development, Weidinger's men stormed the main administrative compound and, after a brief firefight with the guards, took military control of the city. Baku's Gauleiter is currently being detained "for incompetence and corruption" until a "proper trial" can be held. The government in Germania immediately branded Weidinger's men as traitors and ordered their arrest, but even the Führer knows these are but empty words: with no way to transport troops to Baku due to the slave revolt, and the not-so-subtle threat of sabotaging the oil drills hanging in the air, the central government can only wait.\n\nSuspicions are arising, however, over a massive air lift paradropping weapons and supplies from Moskowien, paid for by corporations deeply tied to Abs, Flick and their clique of industrialists. While nothing is certain in these troubled times, few think this is a coincidence: questions will have answers in due time, and answers will prompt a response, the scope of which remains shrouded in the deepest darkness."

No longer shall Adolf Hitler's vile ideology spread any further, kill any more people!" A sort of frenzy of cheering was met in response, for but a moment drowning out the hopelessness and desperation. "I wish for you all to listen. I know of your hatred. All of it is deserved, all of it! To wish for my people to be thrown out of Europe for their crimes, but please- listen, listen to what I have to say! We must end this cycle of hatred here and now!" The cheering voices remained powerful, but quieter than before.\n\n"I know of a Germany - the true Germany, which the Nazis have attempted to eradicate," Brandt took in a deeper breath. "But it shall never die! The light of a democratic Germany can never be extinguished! There is a better future for Europe! We must not stand as slave and master, as Aryan and non-Aryan. We must stand as brother to brother, sister to sister, equal to equal! So please, on behalf of all of Europe, I beg you. Forgive us, for those who have been murdered by this regime never had the chance to!" His hands tightened into fists. His teeth grit harder. The people judged him with their silence. "Forgive us, oh, people of Europe, even if we do not deserve a shred of sympathy, those who know better will continue to fight for freedom." His voice trailed in strength and began showing cracks, and the air became stiff.\n\nWilly Brandt slowly landed on his knees, and bowed his head deeply. As the seconds passed, and nobody said anything, they could notice his frame shaking. And from the shaking, two tears dropped to the wooden platform. He expected the people to suffocate him with their silence, but as one man began to clap, so did ten, so did a hundred, so did a thousand. And as he looked up at those who dared to fight for their freedom, he let a wobbly smile come to his face."

When the judge asked him to bow, he kneeled.\n\n"The court hereby declares Willy Brandt to be a traitor to the Reich.

When two men approached him, he struggled against the handcuffs that forced him to his bench, and even spat out a curse to one of the men - it meant nothing, however. The bag was stuffy and hard to breathe in, and it was almost impossible to see out of it. He felt bitter when he figured out where they were going. Just like the family of the Tsar in Russia, they would take him to a basement and murder him in cold blood. No martyrization. No publicization.\n\nWhen Brandt's head slammed against the concrete wall, his vision swam, and he could feel warm blood seep through his hair. Weakly, his limbs struggled against each other, in a vain attempt to get on his feet, as all the joy and idealism in the world faded from him. This was a Willy Brandt whose light in the world had faded, and though he believed in a Germany free and happy, his efforts had been torn down to nothing.

Your government has been deathly silent as of recent, and it is slowly beginning to unnerve the army of Free Europe. Some say that you are preparing for an attack, but I know better.

I pick it because it is a holy place, and no holy place should be a battlefield for violence. I will also ask you another, perhaps more important thing. As a show of peace, I ask of you to come with only you and your diplomats. There is no need for guns to march between priests and crosses. I am uncertain if you shall follow through with this, but if you do, I will remain ever grateful for the move.\n\nAnd my final statement will be this. To Herr Speer, to you, Helmut Schmidt, to Ludwig Erhard, to Kurt Georg Kiesinger, to Henning von Tresckow. I should congratulate you all for taking Germany so far. It was as dark as shadows before, and for a while I had feared for its existence. But my hope has strengthened, and I am joyous that the free, humane, and democratic Germany still lives. Thank you for your cooperation, and if all goes well, I shall be seeing you soon.\n\n- Willy Brandt."\n\nThere was no time to ponder. Helmut Schmidt had to choose."

 speerreichsbanner.3.desc:0 "When Helmut Schmidt stepped through the door into the St. Alexander's Church, he felt himself enter another world. Something about its air was not the oppressive and dreadful one he could feel outside. It did not echo the cry of slaves, the breaking of chains, none such thing. It was as if Schmidt was thrown into a different universe altogether. Where none of this madness was forced to happen.\n\nThere were only four faces he saw. The only one he recognized by face was Willy Brandt, but he could recognize the others by association. One was Karol Józef Wojtyła, a Catholic priest who Schmidt could immediately recognize in his clothing. Another was Viacheslav Chornovil, though he did not know much of him, and the last was Nadezhda Troyan, former NKVD agent and assassin of Wilhelm Kube. He did not like her beliefs, though respected her guts to do such a thing. All of them, however, remained silent, as Brandt approached him.\n\n"Well, if it isn't the famous Helmut Schmidt." With a wide smile, he brought his hand out and the two gave each other a strong handshake. "I take it that you are a bit more sympathetic to our cause than that friend of yours you call Herr Speer?"\n\nSchmidt, at first, bit his tongue. He didn't want to risk saying the wrong thing - but then he realized just where exactly he was. "Friend..." He huffed a laugh through his nose. "Is not exactly what I would call him, but that's neither here nor there. It will be a pleasure to negotiate these dealings with you, Herr Brandt. I have much reason to support your cause."\n\nBrandt gave Schmidt a sharp look and a sly smile. "To support implies that you have done nothing yet to aid the cause of the Reichsbanner." When he said that, Schmidt was filled with the need to take a step back out of anxiety, but instead let out an amused yet nervous chuckle."

Without hesitance, and with all the promised haste in the world."\n\nHelmut Schmidt nodded. "You know - you are quite the bold one with your demands, Herr Brandt." The leader of the slave revolt merely gave a smile. "And you are giving quite the lack of pushback. Hmm... I would have expected a man of the Reich to be angrier at this, but I appreciate the sanity nonetheless. Now..."\n\n"... on the matter of the protesters, the freedom fighters in Germany, the brave men and women who wish only to liberate those that deserve not the wanton cruelty of the Reich that has plagued them for decades, I demand that they are all let go. To return to their homes in peace, and not for any police force, secret or otherwise, detain or harass or injure them in any way - nor do I want the military to crack down on them."\n\nTo Schmidt, this was almost like having a pleasant conversation with a friend. "I could not guarantee their safety, though there would be hell to pay if anyone decided to commit violence to them." Brandt let out a short laugh. "Good, good. Now, the final demand." He cleared his throat.\n\n"On the matter of repatriation. I demand that Germany begin immediate and extensive reparations to all slaves and their families. They will be compensated in full, as for the evil that the Reich has wrought on them must be cleansed, even if it will take decades for it to rinse away completely. The terms are non-negotiable, Herr Schmidt. Do you agree?"\n\nSchmidt blinked once or twice at the last demand. That would have put a major strain on Germany's budget, but... what right did he have to deny them that? It took him mere seconds to respond."

A pity though, because his interlocutor had none to spare for him: a laugh was the only answer to his pleas, one that had anything but mirth in it.\n"How entertaining! The proud Helmuth Schmidt is begging! If only you could be here in my office, I'd give half of the Reich, MY Reich, only to see your face!" came the Führer's voice.\n"I have always wanted to see the face a traitor makes when he's reduced to begging for his useless life! Not a big loss, though... Rewards come to the patient, and guess who I have right outside of my office?"\n\n"You wouldn't dare-"\n\n"That's right! The almighty Gang of Four! Ungrateful bastards, I saved you from Heydrich! I covered your crimes for years! You would be nothing without me, NOTHING! But now I can finally have my revenge. Sweet, sweet revenge, for all the humiliations, for all the times you threatened me, you sniveling wretches... Don't try to flee, little cheater, don't rob me of my pleasure: I'll find you and kill you even in Washington..." then the tone changed again, and Speer was laughing once more.\n"Enjoy your last hours, there are so many things you can do: hanging, poison, or the great classic, a bullet! Choose quickly, or I'll be the one to do it for you... Oh, before I forget: make yourself pretty, the ORPO is coming..."\n\nThe line went dead, but Schmidt was no longer focused on it. He was too terrorized to care about it, and not because of Speer's death threats: his fearful gaze was fixed on the mirror in front of him. His own reflection was staring at him, along with his father, and thousands of faces, all chanting the same word, over and over and over and over and over.\n"Traitor!" screamed his father, rage twisting his old face into a hate-filled grimace.\n"Traitor!" laughed his own reflection, blood gushing from a hole in his forehead.\n"Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!" echoed all the men, women and children in the room. All of them dead, including himself. All of them dead, and it was his fault. His and his alone."

No children played in the abandoned school: as the rabbi - an old man who had seen so much suffering and pain that God would have needed to build a new paradise just for him - once said, who would be so evil to let a child be born only to suffer?\n\nTherefore, it was with a heart as heavy as the gates of the ghetto that the rabbi listened to the unmistakable creaking sound, but when he looked outside, no one was there: in the place of the Germans was a poster. His heart filled with fear - was it the order of their extermination? - but he steeled himself and read.\n\n"Extract from the Law on Racial Equality as published on the Reichsgesetzblatt [GetDateText], to be entered into force the day of its publication.\nSection 1, Paragraph 1: "sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Citizen Law and sections 1 to 7 of the Law for Protection of German Blood and German Honor, as promulgated and published on Reichsgesetzblatt Part I, 16th September 1935 and entered into force the day 1st of January 1936 are hereby abrogated".\nParagraph 2: "mention of race in any law, regulation or administrative directive within the Reich is to be replaced by ethnicity"\nSection 2, Paragraph 1: "no man may be subjected to discrimination or any punishment or labor for the sole fact of his belonging to any ethnicity"\nParagraph 2: "economic reparation for subjection to any of the treatments mentioned in the above paragraph will be distributed according to a future law"\n\nFor a minute, the old rabbi looked at the paper in disbelief, then the first tears descended in the channels that so many years of silent crying had dug into his cheeks. Finally, he turned his head to the heavy gates that had been the end of their world for three decades, and he saw them open, the first ray of the morning sun carving a path to the exit: he knew it then, he knew how Moses had felt when the waters of the Red Sea had opened before him.

Now they were opposing each other on the table that stood in the middle of the church, and the warm graces of Wojtyła's voice soothed Schmidt's nerves.\n\n"I am no German," he began, his thick Polish accent rising through the silence, "but I'm sure you will understand me all the same." Schmidt gave a polite nod, and ushered him to continue. Wojtyła gave a light smile.\n\n"My son, I am sure you are aware that there cannot be peace in this... Einheitspakt of yours, unless its people are allowed to voice their opinions freely." Schmidt pressed his hands together. The worst was out of the way. Now came what he would call the 'secondary demands', and here he would have to weigh whether to hold back or push in. The priest continued. "I merely ask you this. Let them have their voices be heard. Many fight against it... the change that your Reich has brought. Not only in Germany, but everywhere else, too. I see them fighting for something better. The rest, I am sure, share my sentiments."\n\nThe rest - Brandt, Viacheslav, Nadezhda, all of them nodded silently. Schmidt, meanwhile, sighed. "I understand, Herr Wojtyła.

Brandt looked to have traces of nervousness rise in his throat - and both men were surprised, Schmidt more so. "I'm... going to flee to the U.S. I thought I should let you know. I cannot assist you in Germania or elsewhere. All that would net me would be a hanging. A shame, but... at least Reichsbanner has done its duty."\n\nSchmidt gave a slow, understanding nod. "I suppose I can admit something to you, too, my friend." Brandt let out a quiet, amused chuckle at 'friend', but his frown did not turn up. "I don't know what's going to happen.. Something tells me... if I come home, to Berlin, I will see that Speer has gone mad, and that it will all end there. Then it will truly be the last days of Europe. Maybe it's my growing paranoia."\n\nBrandt stayed silent for the next few seconds, contemplating his words. Then he spoke. "Herr Schmidt... think it over again. Are you so certain that everything you have done is for naught?" Schmidt felt the anxiety creep up his mind. "Tell me," Brandt began, his eyes turning to gaze into the other man's own, and he looked at Schmidt with an utmost sense of clarity. "I want your answer to be the most honest it can be. Not just with me - but also with yourself. What do you feel?"\n\nHelmut Schmidt caught the initial wave of impulsiveness in his throat; throwing all but one emotion into the back of his head, he then spoke."

 speerreichsbanner.19.desc:0 "He didn't want to go. Ever since he had that talk with Brandt, his anxiety had only gotten worse. So bad that he was starting to feel sick, but now was no time to take a vacation. Schmidt had to push through to the end. Even if it meant pushing through the meeting that Speer had called him to.\n\nLight-headed and feeling weak, Schmidt stepped into Speer's office. He was already sitting there, palms clasped against each other, fingers interlocked neatly as if he had been there for hours, waiting for just the right person to arrive - and, by the look on Speer's face, he had just received his visitor. "Herr Schmidt. I'm glad you've arrived. I won't ask you to take a seat, simply that I've been wanting to tell you something. Ever since you forced my hand to abolish the Nuremberg laws-" Why did he go? Why didn't he call in sick? "-there is, currently, nothing necessarily allowing for discrimination against a man of the Jewish race."\n\nSpeer was an old, worn-out man, and yet the energy he gave was much younger and much brighter. As if he was calling to something from the past. His smile widened slightly as he looked over Schmidt's face. "What is the problem, Helmut Schmidt? Go on. Co-operation between me and the Gang of Four has always been crucial to our survival these past two decades, has it not? Go on, Herr Schmidt. What is the problem?"\n\nIt was as if Schmidt was staring into the face of madness. He resisted the urge to run, as his legs tightened and he felt it so difficult to breathe properly, and he had a deathly want to avoid having the sweat form on his brow. "Nothing." A lie. "My Führer. There is nothing wrong."\n\nSpeer gave a nod. "That's very good. In that case, I figure that you already know what I'm going to ask of you, but, it's been long, long overdue. In fact, it's strange how I never..." He gave a short chuckle. "How I never thought of it in the first place. All I wish to do is one thing, going forward with our partnership.""

 speerreichsbanner.20.desc:0 "Schmidt had recently arrived back in Germania, and the return to the Reichskanzlei only filled him with dread. He did not know what to expect when he walked through that main door into the building. Many thoughts popped into his head. Most of them were a mixture between unpleasant and gruesome, leaning towards the latter. But Schmidt couldn't worry himself forever - he had to continue.\n\nSo when Schmidt entered the Reichskanzlei and stepped into the long, glossy hallway, the lights from the patterned glass above shone down into the room and illuminated none other than Albert Speer. Next to him were what he immediately recognized as members of the Ordnungspolizei. Schmidt almost mistook the skip of his heartbeat as a heart attack.\n\n"Herr Schmidt." His tone was a casual one, but Schmidt couldn't mistake the intention. It was as if Speer was the one in control here. "I'm ordering your immediate arrest. I suggest you do not flee." He was pressed into going on the backfoot. To turn and run - no, things were different now. It was no longer the Führer who had his strings attached everywhere he went. The situation had changed.\n\nHelmut Schmidt shook his head, and the Ordnungspolizei stopped moving towards him, standing halfway between Speer and Schmidt. "I'm afraid not, my Führer." He could already see the hatred begin to burn brighter in his eyes, and how his hands began trembling. "There will be no arrest. You should be aware that there is absolutely no reason why this order should be carried out. Do you have a reason, my Führer? You do not need one to arrest me, but you and I both know that doing so would cause your support to turn on you." Speer's whole body began shaking, and he breathed heavily.\n\n"Schmidt... for all these years..." With an unsteady hand, Speer reached into the coat he was wearing, and Schmidt's eyes widened. "I made sure to empty out the Reichskanzlei today. Just..."\n\n"No!" Schmidt shouted, and the Ordnungspolizei turned around, themselves spiking in fear as they saw the Führer draw a pistol.\n\n"Just s-so I could kill you."\n\n"SPEER!""

 speerreichsbanner.21.desc:0 ""Tell me, Schmidt."\n\nThe two of them had a discussion just minutes earlier about the Reichsbanner itself. Such a vigorous conversation it was - Schmidt found himself enthralled by all the information that Brandt had about it. Such a noble organization - in his mind, at least - stomped into the ground by the NSDAP, and then fading into irrelevance; and then, like a flash, it ruptured from its grave and returned as a major power, going head to head with Germany itself to negotiate the terms of freedom. Yet Schmidt had disappointed Brandt.\n\n"What is it, Brandt?"\n\nThey discussed the matters of protesting, too. Both men were in agreement about how important it was to showcase that the nation did allow itself to display that the people were free, that they had a voice. But what Schmidt differed from Brandt was how to go about it. Brandt scrutinized Schmidt for a while after they came to terms, to determine if he truly believed that the time for protesting was a transformation, a process that had to be carefully managed, or was it something else?\n\n"Are you a coward?"\n\nSchmidt felt the question was like a dagger pressed to his heart. He knew that Brandt had wanted to press him, but this... being so blunt and so direct contrasted the previous, friendly nature that the man had shown him. Doubt coursed through his mind, and as Brandt stared at him with that same look he gave after Schmidt offered his suggestion of a compromise, words failed him momentarily. What was dry air that came out of his mouth was then replaced by what he would call a realization. After nigh ten seconds of silence, Schmidt spoke."

 speerreichsbanner.22.desc:0 "From the top floor of the St. Alexander's Church, Schmidt could see all the people passing about. So many of them armed with weapons that dated back to the Second World War, and though he could spot a few that carried guns which were likely stolen from armories or taken from the hands of the local guards, it was like watching a ragtag group of rebels rather than anything that resembled a proper army. And while so many looked sad, bitter, depressed, even - so many more were happy, overjoyed, clinking glasses with one another and sitting around and sharing stories, tales, poems, confessions.\n\n"Schmidt..." The slurred voice of Willy Brandt alerted Schmidt to his presence, and he turned his head to see the revolutionary smile tiredly towards him. "I'm... glad you listened." The shot glass in his hand was unsteady as he dangled it over the edge of the church's top floor. Then Brandt turned from looking at Schmidt to looking at the city. "I was w-worried, frankly, that- well, no need to bring your spirits down. You want a drink, Schmidt?" A distinct lack of 'Herr', but neither man seemed to mind.\n\nHesitance painted his words. "... Sorry, Herr Brandt. Not much of a drinker. I'm also a diplomat, and diplomats should probably lay off the alcohol," he said, pointedly giving a half-serious glare towards Brandt, who looked at him with a smile that cracked into grin after a few seconds. Schmidt himself eventually gave a smirk.\n\n"Quit staring at me like that, Schmidt, it's-" He gave out a short laugh. "Stop!" Schmidt could feel his own lips quivering, and, perhaps to save face or just to listen to Brandt's demands, he turned away before he succumbed to Brandt finding it funny. "You know, Schmidt... you might still be a Nazi in the eyes of the people, but to me, you're... you're a better man than anyone in Germania's high castle."\n\nSchmidt suddenly felt a pang of embarrassment. A strong fear and source of doubt kept pulling at his consciousness - that he would be cast down into the annals of history as a traitor and a Nazi. Maybe it was true; maybe, once he finally died and fulfilled his role, his role would be that of a forgotten soldier. But if at least one person knew, just one, then..."

My father attended in the September of 1892. He had found it such an interesting set of notes and tones that I heard it multiple times.

The piano overlapped with itself, and Grigory could picture it.\n\nRubble that crushed men and women without care, and soldiers digging shallow ditches and riddling children full of holes.

As he decried Willy Brandt, as he decried Reichsbanner, the slaves both now and former who grabbed their rifles and shotguns and desired freedom, he felt liberated.\n\nHow energetic he felt. He could barely contain himself after the speech was finished. Those violent thoughts he had, of slaves being gunned down, men dying by the droves, now had become reality. Did they deserve it? Perhaps not. Perhaps they merely did not know better, and thought that violent uprising was a smarter solution that to remain put and loyal like good subjects of the Reich. It didn't matter now.

After struggling to read a few paragraphs over and over, trying to remember and understand the words written out in front of him, he let out a frustrated sigh and set it down against the table. What had happened gnawed at his mind. Of everything that he was expecting Albert Speer to do... of everything that could have happened, he had decided to risk everything just so that he could have a shot at fulfilling his revenge. A fool. A madman. That's what Speer was.\n\nThe knocks on his door jolted him awake, and though he was initially gripped by fear, he quickly steadied his nerves, making himself comfortable in his seat and giving a quick roll of his shoulders as two men came in. He had called them in this morning, and, now that they had finally arrived, Schmidt could calm his own worries somewhat. With a sharp, professional tone, he addressed them both.\n\n"For your silence, expect your paychecks to be increased significantly. In return, I want not a word of this to escape anywhere.

The things Erik had to do to join this newly-formed anti-terrorist group made him regret coming, but how could he back out now?\n\nWith the swastika emblazoned on his urban camouflage clothing, a variety of utilitarian tools at his side and a rifle that slung over his back, he and a couple of other RSG-9 members had hastily exited their barracks and made their way to an abandoned two-story house that was repurposed as a building to practice hostage rescue scenarios. It was deep into the night when they pulled up and prepared themselves, reciting through the countless hours of forced listening they had to go through.\n\nThat brought him here. When Erik kicked in the door, he felt his head go light, but procedures had to be followed, and through the pain that pulsed across his body, the headache that made his mind feel raw and vulnerable, and the resulting gunshots that rung his ears as he screamed out methodical orders to both would-be terrorists and his own two men, he wondered to himself; wandering through with gun and flashlight, nerves frayed yet still on edge - what would his skills be pressed for? The former slaves? The students? ANTIFA? None seemed particularly dangerous, yet Erik was put through hell for a reason only the higher-ups would know. He could only theorize one answer."

Of course he wasn't, but why did he feel so nervous? Erhard looked at himself in the mirror. Things had developed far since the devastation of the civil war. With his genius, Germany pulled itself out of the rubble and soared once again. Then came all of his reforms, as dangerous as they were, as utterly maddening it was to many, it worked. Too well, in fact.\n\nNothing good can last forever. Germany's economy was strong, but built on glass links. It was a powerhouse, yet when the oil crisis had come to strike Germany, it bled like a stuffed pig, too weak to fend itself as it relied on its shared feed. Not only that, people were waking up to the fact that not all was well. They would demand change, and if there was anything Erhard hated, it was his efforts being undone.\n\nWith a sigh, Erhard shut the lights to the bathroom and prepared to go to sleep; his mind was overfilled with thoughts, though he knew that there was always more work to be done.

For the sake of 'stability' and 'diversifying the strengths of National Socialism'. Vague nothingness like that. He felt the slightest bit of irritation, but, what could he do? Though he had his fair share of connections, nothing could stand up to Speer's decision.\n\nLudwig Erhard groaned when he had read the letter that arrived at his table. Speer's antics had cropped up once more. Now he was to be the co-Minister of Economics and Labor. What nonsense was this? Did Speer think so little of his efforts to brighten the future of Germany's economy - and succeeding heartily, at that - only to be forced to share space with what was likely some faceless bureaucrat? He would have marched into Speer's office then and there upon receiving the news, but... his friends within the Reich dwindled, and he knew what Speer was doing, and Speer knew what he was doing.\n\nHelmut Schmidt felt his teeth grind together when he was approached by a messenger.

Germany's territorial expansion bloomed - so much territory, so densely packed, so rich with people, industry and resources, it filled him with a sense of joy, that the Reich truly was the dominator of Europe.\n\nBut the Gang of Four had forced his hand into doing something that he was never truly satisfied with. The Reichskommissariats were an inefficient thing, a product of a past era - riddled with corruption and slavery. He could understand the concerns of some with the concept of the Reichsländer, but to Speer, the idea was such that he couldn't possibly pass it by. Direct subjects of the Reich, with a vague semblance of freedom; while they would never officially undergo the process of Germanization, seeing that it was well and truly too expensive and risky of a process, they would still be influenced by German civilization.\n\nThat night Speer had decided. The collaborationists had to go. The natives wouldn't be pleased with it, and he would have to make it a slow process, but he knew, in his heart, that this would be better for all. For the Reich to receive its just rewards of victory, and for the men and women of the East to be taught their place.

He found it beautiful, yes, but there were so many other things that had occupied his time that he could not spare a visit to it. Now, however, he felt at ease. When Adolf Hitler had died, his body had been transported to Germania and been given a proper burial and a memorial service even as the civil war had raged on - but Speer, with his personal funds, and over the course of the decade, had asked, petitioned, and convinced for the body of Hitler to be moved to Linz. His love of the city was strong, and in turn, so was Speer's.\n\nNot only that, however. His body did not deserve to be in a mere grave to rot. Instead, Speer had built a mausoleum for his predecessor, and he had meticulously planned every inch of it. As he stood in front of the tomb that housed his paternal figure, he smiled. Everything about it was right. All the details, the vaguely religious yet still National Socialist elements that covered the inside. Perhaps, in a way, this was his greatest work yet - barring Germania, of course.\n\nBut he hadn't come merely to admire his own architectural genius. No, there was something more. There was a man he had respected for as long as he had lived, and now he had passed. Yet Speer never truly gave him the proper respect he deserved. For without him, there would be no Reich to begin with - but without Speer, the Reich would not have survived. As he kneeled in front of the tomb, he uttered no prayer, he made no motion of bowing to a deity. Instead, his was a silent admiration of the highest degree.\n\nEverything Albert Speer had learned from his father was now passed on to him, yet reshaped, moulded to serve the rapidly-changing future. Would he have understood it? Speer wouldn't know; but he would have respected him. For now there was no need to play nice with the enemies of the Reich. Power was his, and no other's. He was the NSDAP, and the NSDAP was his. A sort of tingling pride was felt in him, a sensation that he was, as treacherous as it would have been to say, an even better leader than he who had guided him all those years.

Hitler and his regime had built it up in such a way that even when he had visited Barmbek, the old village where he spent his childhood days, there was barely anything that resembled what he had known for two decades, and he had walked through it like he would have any other district. There was one place, however, that would remain unchanged - and it was just next to Barmbek.\n\nThe Außenalster always remained the same. He knew the Nazis couldn't have tainted its water. Somewhere along the coast, Schmidt had stood at the edge of the water and stared as all the sailing boats passed. He remembered being on one with his father as a child, demanding to go back in and loop around when they were done. Now there were so many others. People, sometimes alone and sometimes together, and sometimes with their children, enjoying themselves in a way that was now alien to him. Yet the air was so much lighter now. Ten years since Schmidt had entered into the dark tunnel, the light had begun to pour in. So much fear, so much anxiety, contrasted by the serenity of the peace that he felt while in Hamburg.\n\nSchmidt looked down at his arm. That bright, burning reminder that seared his flesh and assaulted his mind whenever he looked at it. The armband he wore that was a constant reminder that he deserved to be afraid, deserved to die. But no more would he force himself to follow the orders of a mad man. He had done what many could never do. He did not feel prideful for it, as a man who dodges a death sentence would feel proud about avoiding the inevitable. Instead, as his fingers tugged under the fabric, and it slid across his arm, he felt relief. Sheer, unmitigated relief.\n\nWhen the armband slipped from his wrist and slid against and out from the grasp of his fingers and landed in the water with a silent thump, Schmidt breathed. Everything felt so much clearer than it did before. He could finally live. His judge, jury, and executioner would never pursue him again. But there was work to do, and so Schmidt turned around and began walking. He knew what he had to do."

 speerphase3.11.desc:0 "The German Reich has found itself at a standstill. As it has begun the process of opening up, it has similarly undergone a transformation. It is no longer an economy that maintains stark autarky and hostile, almost war-like relations with the other superpower. Instead it has unlatched itself from its old ways and now floats aimlessly in this new world, attempting to cling on to both the past as a giant who conquered Europe and beat back the imperialist world powers, and the present, as a dove wishing to extend the olive branch, either out of a sense of good will, or sheer pragmatism.\n\nOur new order cannot shift and ebb and be so fluid as it was before. If it is to become the rock that will bear the coming storm, Germany cannot be everchanging. It must steady itself - it must not rock the boat, and it must find its way forwards. There is no more time to bicker between the debates of the many sides in our country; a way is put, the path is clear, and we need only go down it."

They existed only to expand their influence and combat their enemies, as peace was hardly seen as a viable alternative in the years following Germany's glorious triumph. Yet now, decades later, we see that there is something new brewing.\n\nThe Oil Crisis has struck the world as a knife to exposed flesh. It has exploited the weakness found in all of the blocs that encompass the world, every superpower attempting to take it on by themselves, only to find that such a course of action is not only inefficient, but actively detrimental.\n\nAlong with it, the revolt of the slaves has shown Germany that it cannot stand alone. We have made token efforts to appease the other two superpowers, true, but it is finally time for the Reich to stand together in full earnest with the rest. The Einheitspakt cannot be solely Germany and its puppets. It can be more. For the good of the world, it must be."

With the intensive modernizations of China, they are rapidly beginning to climb to the status of a co-equal partner within the Sphere. An insight into Japanese politics tells us that there is heavy friction about the idea that China could ever possibly be anything more than a puppet to the Sphere, and thus their internal stability is beginning to fall.\n\nIt's advised to pursue stronger diplomatic and trade relations with the Organization of Free Nations - particularly the U.S. The state of their internal politics is much stronger than that of Japan, and they have a massive and still growing economy that we could expand our interests into, as well as having a large surplus of raw and refined goods. Also, China is a nation with a vast, untapped population, industrial potential, and common outlook. Advised to form interests with them as well.

In this new era, our nations have prospered. But a new problem has developed. As the world has grown richer, more connected with each other, we now run the risk of collapse. The Oil Crisis struck not only Germany, but the world as a whole, and it has ripped open a hole we never thought had existed before.\n\nThe Greater Germanic Reich proposes that a new organization be formed. One that would have the intent of safeguarding peace across the planet, as war only serves to further destroy the economies of the nations affected. It would also serve as a way to bring all of our nations closer - think of it as global cooperation. The name of it is simple; the Koalition der Nationen. Currently there are no concrete plans to establish one, but the Reich has shown a keen interest in the idea. We ask you this:\n\nAre you of the same mind?"

He never truly was a fan of war. It was a costly affair. A glorious one, you could say, but look where it led the reich to. Men like Bormann, men like Göring...\n\nMen like Heydrich.\n\nSpeer shuddered. What visceral carnage they would have wrought upon the Reich. They were long gone now, however. Only phantoms. And with the Gang of Four out of his way, and the NSDAP following his will and his voice, he would make the finishing touches to his precious Reich - his final test, that came not in the form of a revolt, or dealing with dissent. It came as a goal to secure the future of the Thousand Year Reich.\n\nThe Koalition der Nationen transcended all of his previous architectural goals. Germania would be merely a backdrop in comparison as to what will come. Albert Speer's will was powerful, and after having dealt with the brunt of the Reich's issues all at once, he pulled out victorious. This time, however, he would have to cement his legacy forever. The KdN in Speer's mind would not only certify Germany's dominion over Europe.\n\nIt would seat them as the leader of the world. The greatest house that Albert Speer would begin crafting started now."

We should be working as close as possible to get a theoretical framework of what a Koalition would look like, make certain to the other two superpowers that it would be worth their time joining. However..." Kiesinger let a second or two of silence pass before he continued. "Herr Speer, Helmut. He's a volatile element."\n\nAs Schmidt took in his words, he momentarily closed his eyes and thought. Then, he shook his head. "No," he began with a sigh. "Speer is quite the stable substance, I would say." Kiesinger looked at him with suspicion, but Schmidt's in return glowed with confidence. "I have seen him at his very worst, Kurt. He is nothing but a hollow shell of a man. He is a liar, a coward, a thief, and an architect of nothing but murder. To name any positive traits about him would be deluding myself. To your eyes, that would make him unstable. But to me..." Schmidt turned around in his chair and looked to the window outside. "He is the perfect puppet."\n\nKiesinger froze up for a moment. He hadn't expected the man who grazed death under the presence of the Führer to so openly denigrate him. "So you have no worries, then. I see. A question, however." Schmidt made no motion to decline answering. "Would you dare say this all to his face? If he is such a weak puppet, then you would get away with doing so."\n\nSchmidt's stoic frown cracked, and he gave a small smile.

speerescalation.4.t:0 "Garmr Has Broken Free"
speerescalation.4.desc:0 "Germany's forefathers, the norse Aryans of the North, believed that one day Götterdämmerung, or Ragnarök, would envelop the world. The first sign of this end of days would be when a great Wolf, Garmr, broke free from his chains and was set loose. Following this, countryman would turn on countryman. Brother on brother. Earth would be torn asunder.\n\nHe had left it too late. He had not put Garmr back in chains. No, he had been a fool. An idiot, all things considered. That devil in the east, Schörner, was a rabid dog in every sense of the word. Foul, vicious and savage. Speer knew that when an animal goes feral, there is only one humane choice, for it and for all around it: putting the dog down. Yet he hadn't. Out of some fear, or stupid sympathy, or pure idiocy, Speer had led the dog roam free. Now, he had to endure the reports as they came in, live through that newfangled television of his.\n\nMurder. Massacre. Wholesale slaughter of slaves in the East. Was this Speer in the mirror? Was Schörner just a reflection of the great architect? When he looked at the white marble of Germania, would Speer see anything in his own artistry but the bloodied tapestry of sinews that the Generalfeldmarschall had constructed across the Reichskommissariats? And it was a tapestry. Slavic bodies flung carelessly around. Mass graves dug. Who knows how many thousands more will be killed in the coming weeks? Schörner had what he wanted. The dog was putting his master down.\n\nHe had lost. Now, he would be a Führer only in name. With the students nearing rebellion, the slaves openly revolting, and Speer's underlings turning against him, he felt his dreams disappear. He stood up from his desk, and stood in front of one of the many bookshelves of the Kanzler's office. The Poetic Edda stood out to him. He smiled, with a hint of melancholy. How fitting. He turned to stanza forty-five, and read aloud, alone in the room.\n\n"Brothers shall fight and fell each other, \nand sister's sons shall kinship stain. \nHard is it on earth, with mighty whoredom. \nAxe-time, sword-time, shields are sundered, \nWind-time, wolf-time, 'ere the world falls.""

speerescalation.7.t:0 "Looking Forwards"
speerescalation.7.desc:0 "As a man endures his sixties, he begins to ponder his life. In Germany, most men retire during this twilight decade, putting down the hammers and quills and moving into a life of family and comfort. The free men do, anyway.\n\nKurt's father had been a free man. For him, sixty was only the two-thirds checkpoint in his life, and he lived a happy final third with the wealth of a bank clerk. A shining example of the protestant work ethic, and a reaper of its rewards. He'd only died recently, Kurt remembered. Was it just last year? Time seemed a blur nowadays.\n\nKurt wasn't a man built for retirement. If time was a blur, his duty was not. With the Führer occupied in Moskowien, the student protests continued to cripple the heart of the Reich, and the old Silver Tongue was not about to let the opportunity for a reformed Germany descend into chaos and violence so quickly. Fingers drum on the table as the Deputy Führer stares coldly into middle distance, listening. The sound of a phone being picked up, and Kiesinger begins.\n\n"These lines are not secure, so I shall keep it brief. You know the location already. Where the griffin flies and the seas are sweet with trade. Next Thursday, be at the pier. Let us keep this brief."\n\nAnd like that, Kiesinger hung up the phone. His suitcase for an overnight stay had already been prepared in his room. A plane for Rostock had been organised, and if the Führer couldn't quell the Devil, then his Deputy would have to make a pact himself."
speerescalation.7.a:0 "A truce to terror."

speerescalation.9.t:0 "House of Cards"
speerescalation.9.desc:0 "To Erhard, it appeared as if the house of cards was finally collapsing. Was Speer more tolerable than the Nazi scum before him? Of course. Was his demise in any way an upset to the Minister for the Economy? Not in the slightest. As the Führer's crisis continued to worsen, the man behind the facade of kindness and polite diplomacy had shrunk away, and the demon that Erhard had always seen behind those glassy eyes and forced smiles had reared its ugly head. Unfortunately for Ludwig, the time was not yet right for him and his allies to wrestle a true liberal democracy out of the ruins of the Reich.\n\nIn this sense, the student protests had seemed a tragedy to him. Slavery, tyranny, state control; all valid causes to rally against, and ideals he sympathised with. This particular outburst at the obvious violence of the regime Erhard was forced to collaborate with and the slave uprisings shook the economic minister to his core. Behind his crassness, he had a heart. In front of his crassness, Erhard cringed at the economic stupidity of this Nazi institution and the untold prosperity it had denied Germany.\n\nFor now, Erhard did need to calm the students. Their violent responses, although understandable, were ultimately a hindrance to the obtaining of genuine reform in the Reich. His political invulnerability would be his weapon.\n\nCalls were made, and meetings arranged. Erhard had sent his sympathies out through the protests, spreading rumours that he, and others within the government, were allied with them in the struggle for reform. By dispelling this information secretly, Erhard was gambling on the news not being traced back to him, and that if it was, his importance to the Reich might guarantee immunity from punishment. In time, however, this regime and all it stood for would be erased."

speerescalation.11.t:0 "A New Deal"
speerescalation.11.desc:0 "Germania was called the Welthauptstadt for a reason. If Tokyo, sprawling metropolis of the isles to the East, was the capital of an Empire, then Germania in its size and magnificence was the capital of the world. The massive projects and renovations of old Berlin, and especially the expansion into a surrounding urban sprawl, gave the city plenty of hiding spots, however. The larger a house is, the harder it is to clean, and the dirty corners of the Reich's basement saw little light throughout the decades.\n\nHelmut entered an alley in a local downtown area of Germania's surrounding suburbs. He was dressed quite carefully in a black leather coat over a dark brown jumper. A fedora adorned his head and he wore dark eye glasses, not tinted enough to suggest sunglasses at midnight but not light enough to see his eyes. The outfit was a precautionary measure against the foreign minister being identified in the outer suburbs of his home city.\n\nTwo other men and a woman were already in the alley. They were young, and even in the cover of night, their clothes told their age. Effortful. Jazzy. American. Even as a liberal, Helmut grimaced at the sight.\n\n"Finally. What have you got for us, old man," the woman began.\n\n"Naught but a promise, I'm afraid," Helmut responded. "I cannot get you what you want now, but I can guarantee it comes in due time."\n\n"What kind of a deal is that?" The men tensed, an effort to threaten the aging statesman.\n\n"A deal you'll have to take, my dear, if you want anything done in this wretched country." Schmidt revealed a note from his pocket. "This is the address of a cache of weapons I redirected from some friends in the Heer. They're not for use in some violent rebellion; I want you to know I am on your side and will defend you from this police state I have found myself in. There's more where they come from, when the time comes, but for now I need you to lower tensions and engage in talks with the state. It is the only choice."\n\nThe woman grimaced, but nodded. "Thank you, Herr Schmidt.""
speerescalation.11.a:0 "All in due time."

speerescalation.13.t:0 "Wisdom"
speerescalation.13.desc:0 "Hegel, as a young man, described Napoleon entering the city of Jena as the 'world's soul on horseback'. The man was a hero, despite his crimes, and burned with the energy and charisma that galvanised his country behind him. It seemed to Hegel as if history itself had volunteered for his army. If the philosopher had been a young man today, a student on the sidelines of Frankfurt's protests, perhaps he would have had some similar esteem for the world soul arriving in an armoured car instead.\n\nVon Tresckow arrived in the city with the Orpo. He wore his military uniform that day, iron cross and all, with a furred coat over the top. An imperial elegance held to the Old Prussian. He had not come to fight, he had come to talk.\n\nOver the past few years, Von Tresckow had used his time to reform the police. Primarily, this involved reallocating resources away from weaponry, reducing their numbers, revising tactics and educational programs. Perceptions of Germany's Prussian tradition often confuse traditionalism and patriotism with militarism and dogmatism. Von Tresckow knew that the military and nation were central to a German identity, but they were a restrained force of honour and valor meant to protect freedom, not crush it.\n\nHe was to be an ambassador. Schmidt might have dealt well in foreign embassies, but Von Tresckow had always felt a bond with all common people. These protestors were no different.\n\nAs the Orpo began to form a wall around the students, they screamed in the officers face. This was an expected activity, and the police stood firm, but calm, as they had been trained to do. When Von Tresckow was spotted amongst their ranks, the face of Germany's security ministry became the target of even more verbal abuse. He understood their anger, and despite the protests of some of his own men, he stepped beyond the police barrier into the crowd.\n\n"Germans, gather round. I come not to make war, I come not to preach the Nazi ideal. I came to make peace, I came to listen to the people. So, brothers and sisters, speak."\n\nAnd so they did, until the final of the sun's rays died on the horizon."
