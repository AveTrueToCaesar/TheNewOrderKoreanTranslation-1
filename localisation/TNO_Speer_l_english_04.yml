speerflavor.1.t:0 "Planning Rebellion"
speerflavor.1.d:0 "The back alley of the Kruppstrasse in Frankfurt was a damp and dingy place at night, rarely visited or checked by any of the passing guards. Flanked by 4 wings of the local Krupp factory, each producing their own variant of metalworks, it was a perfect place for meetings of the more secretive kind. Indeed, it was this exact reason why the man silently stood against the wall, waiting for his comrades to join him.\n\nOne by one, they made their way out of the blocks they called home, sneaking over to the same wall and avoiding the lazy flashlight beams that occasionally flicked down the road. When the last conspirator, a man of slim frame, squeezed out of the hole in the wall of his barracks and slid over to the wall, the first man blew a sigh of relief. He was the one that the first man had prayed would return.\n\n"So, Rasmus. How did they respond?"\n\n"Wing A is ready. They're practically chomping at the bit to go now."\n\nThe second man barely held in a laugh of glee. "Holy shit, it's really all coming together! I never thought I'd see the day we all grew balls and went after the Germans!"\n\n"It's a goddamn miracle, Mykyta." Said the third man, a faint smile crossed his lips. Out of all of the men, he had been a slave for the longest, toiling for years over his machines and tools, always at the mercy of the Nazis. Finally, the slaves were taking back some control.\n\n"Jan. You wanted to be the one to start the fight, didn't you?" Asked the first to the third. Jan's smile widened again.\n\n"Mikhail. You don't even have to ask- I'd start it myself, with or without you."\n\n"Then it's settled." MIkhail straightened himself up, shifting his uncomfortable slave uniform around. "Tell your friends- we're going in 3 days. We'll overpower the guards, capture the factory, and get out."\n\n"And then?" Nikita asked.\n\n"And then," Mikhail continued, "We're free.""
speerflavor.1.a:0 "What are they up to...?"

speerflavor.2.t:0 "A Crash, a Shot, and a Revolt"
speerflavor.2.d:0 " A crash rose above the standard noise of the factory floor, and like the moment after a thunderclap, all went silent. The guard, who had been slowly making his way around the floor, perked up for a moment. It was not often that he got to punish a slave anymore- indeed, for the last few days, they had been more quiet than ever. He had not been the only one to notice this- the guards in the other wings had complained about the slowness of the last days just as much as he had. Of course, he was sure the executives who watched over it all didn't mind- less disturbances meant more productivity. Now, however, the guard had his chance to finally enjoy the power of his job.\n\nThe other slaves seemed to part like a wave as he pushed his way through to the offender, an older man who the guard had seen- and punished- many times before. Splayed out across the floor lay the box of tools the slave had been using. A foolish error, and one that would not go unpunished, thought the guard.\n\n"Pick that up," stated the guard, pointing to a wrench that lay close to his feet. The man did not move. The guard smirked- a rebellious streak had always been apparent in this one. He resolved to teach him a few lessons in manners as he pulled out his baton. Quickly and forcefully, he pushed the man back with it, planting the tip squarely in the slave's sternum.\n\n"Pick it up, boy," the guard said again, louder and more threatening than before. Still, the man did not move. The guard responded by striking the man to the ground with a swing from the baton. Finally, the slave crawled over to the wrench and picked it up, standing as he did so. The guard smiled, his victory confirmed.\n\nHis smile would remain on his face up until the slave, whirling around, slammed the wrench directly into his jaw.\n\nThe guard collapsed to the ground, stars whirling around his vision. In a mix of anger and rage, he reached for his gun, raising it towards the rebellious ingrate. His shot went wild into the ceiling as a multitude of hands grabbed him, knocking him back to the floor and wrestling the pistol from his hands. Across the factory floor, the sounds of chaos replaced the previous silence, and the guard could only wonder how long the slaves had waited for this day before he lost consciousness."
speerflavor.2.a:0 "The revolution has begun!"

speerflavor.3.t:0 "Digging In"
speerflavor.3.d:0 "In the chaos of the Kruppstrasse, one man made his way quickly through the crowd of slaves. Jan still held the wrench that had started the whole affair close to his chest as he pushed through the turmoil, searching for his fellow leaders. It was a difficult task, made more difficult by those who recognized him trying to give their compliments and praise. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of pushing and shoving, he reached the other three. Mykyta, Mikhail, and Rasmus all stood on a metal catwalk above the street, watching as hundreds of slaves either made a break for freedom, grabbed weapons from the now wide-open doors of the factory armories, or barricaded the streets in preparation for the inevitable police response. As Jan joined them, Rasmus's eyes locked onto a chain of guards and executives, all being led into one factory as hostages. They were not the only ones.\n\n"...took longer than we thought to clear out Wing 4, but we got it in the end - look at that, it's the man of the hour." Rasmus turned to Jan, a smile crossing his face. "How'd Wing 2 go, Jan?"\n\n"Perfect. I really nailed the son of a bitch who went after me. If you guys see a guard with a fucked-up mouth, tell him I said hello. How about you fellows?"\n\n"Wing 1 and 3 went smoothly as well" Mikhail chimed in, "though Wing 4 took a little longer than we hoped. The men there didn't realize we had started until the guards began locking the place down. In any case, the whole plan succeeded so far."\n\nThe men looked back down onto the street, watching the turmoil. Jan's eyes latched onto one group of slaves, currently making a break for it out into Frankfurt. They reached the corner where the Kruppstrasse turned onto another street, then froze. Suddenly, each of them dashed back to the barricades, inaudibly shouting. A wave of commotion swept through those who still were inside the barricades.\n\nAs each of the leaders turned towards the frenzy, the source of the chaos became apparent. Three police cars sped past the corner, sliding to a stop with a screech of tires. They sped off just as quickly when a hail of panicked gunshots rained down the street, bullets pinging off their cars as they got out of the area. The four men looked at each other, each realizing what was to come.\n\n"I'll get defenses set up." Mykyta said, turning to the stairs. "Be prepared for anything. And, brothers, if this becomes our last stand, make sure to take as many of them with you as you can."\n\nThe men said nothing. There was work to be done."
speerflavor.3.a:0 "The siege begins."

speerflavor.4.t:0 "No Everyday Patrol"
speerflavor.4.d:0 "Johann's patrol car was not used to moving so quickly, and screeched in protest to being treated so roughly at every corner. Inside the car, Johann himself listened intently to the police radio. It was a struggle to make out independent facts or statements with the amount of information flowing in. Tales of escaping slaves causing havoc through Frankfurt were swiftly cut off by reports of general chaos, multiple gunshots, and an increasingly flustered radio operator trying in vain to restore order on the airwaves. None of this mattered to Johann- he had his orders, and he already knew what he was supposed to do.\n\nTwo patrol cars, evidently headed to the same location as he was, fell in behind him as he continued to roar down the main avenues. Cars lay abandoned at the side of the road as the police cars roared past, evidence of the growing chaos that was engulfing the industrial side of town. Finally, Johann and the others pulled up to the perimeter that had been set up, and witnessed a scene of pure chaos.\n\nWhile the street itself was empty- the police presence had been enough to scare any running slaves back to their holes- a full block had been abandoned to the rebellion, with the perimeter having been set up just around the corner from where the rebellious factory was located. Worried, angry, and above all else confused officers chattered to each other, setting up their own police barricade.\n\nJohann stepped out of his car and made his way to the nearest face he recognized. The sergeant quickly snapped to attention as he saw the captain approach.\n\n"Wachtmeister Schneider. Status report, if you will." Johann said curtly.\n\n"It's like nothing I've ever seen before, Oberstleutnant. They've flipped containers and made them barricades, they've boarded up doors and windows, they've got weapons everywhere- they've built a damn fortress." Schneider panted. Johann kept walking, heading towards the corner that stood between the police and the revolters. He stuck his head around for a moment to confirm what Schneider had said.\n\nEven though Johann had fought in the Civil War, his mouth nearly fell open at the spectacle of a barricade, defended by slaves still in their working clothes, armed to the teeth with rifles, pistols, and shotguns. It, indeed, was like nothing he had ever seen before. His shock was so great that it took Schneider to pull him back around the corner when multiple bullets cracked off the wall.\n\n"Herr Oberstleutnant, you see what I mean, yes?" Schneider asked."
speerflavor.4.a:0 "We're going to need the Wehrmacht for this."

speerflavor.5.t:0 "Emergency Meeting"
speerflavor.5.d:0 "Speer wanted to bury his face in his hands. Of course this would happen to him. The only time a slave revolt ever succeeds, and it's under him. Across from him sat the men of the Gang of Four, each looking similarly downtrodden as Speer. Next to them sat Hans Speidel, calm as always, though his uncomfortable fidgeting did betray a hint of worry. Each of these men would occasionally look over to the phone on Speer's desk, which at any second was all but certain to ring with the voice of Ferdinand Schörner. Speer could already imagine the look of glee on Schörner's face as he heard the news, and he shuddered to think of the tongue-lashing that would come.\n\n"So." Speer quietly said,"How many slaves were in the factory?"\n\nHelmut fidgeted uncomfortably. "Around 800, my Führer."\n\n"Christ." Speer sighed. "And how many do we estimate are still fighting?"\n\nA long, uncomfortable silence punctuated the air as each of the men in the office looked at each other. Finally, Speidel spoke up."We estimate between 200 and 300, but there's no way of knowing how many are inside the wings."\n\nSpeer audibly groaned. "I don't see why we don't move in, take the factory back, end this mess.\n\n"With the amount of hostages they've got in there?" Schmidt questioned. "We'll be lucky if we get ten of them out alive if we throw the Wehrmacht in."\n\n"Besides that," Kiesenger interrupted, "We've already received some ground reports that students from nearby universities are aiding escaping slaves hide from police patrols. Their reaction to a full-blown shootout may be. . .ugly."\n\n"Must we speak of the politics of the matter? This is the worst hostage crisis we've faced in our history." Speidel interjected. "Now, if you would allow me, I have a plan-"\n\nThe phone rang, and each of the men tensed. Slowly, Speer picked it up. He listened for a moment, then held the receiver away from his ear to notify the others."
speerflavor.5.a:0 "It's Schörner."

speerflavor.6.t:0 "Schörner's Plan"
speerflavor.6.d:0 ""Herr Schörner, please, calm yourself."\n\n"My Führer, I will calm myself when the situation is no longer so volatile. For now, we are looking at the worst slave revolt in years! How could you expect any good citizen to be calm in such a situation?"\n\nThe five other men in the room could barely make out Schörner's voice, tinny and canned as it was. Speer himself could hear all too much of it- the Field Marshal was practically screaming into his ear. He leaned back in his chair, distancing himself from the receiver. If he didn't, the urge to hang up on the man would eventually overpower him.\n\n"So what's your suggestion, Ferdinand? I'm sure I can guess the gist of it." He asked. There was a moment of silence on the other end, and the rest of the room leaned in to hear it better.\n\n"Send in the tanks, the armored cars, the planes, the Wehrmacht. Take them out-" Each of the men in the room reacted in their own special way. Schmidt threw his hands up in the air, Speidel sighed, and the other men of the Gang exchanged looks of displeasure. Speer, however, remained silent."-as fast as you can, casualties be damned. If we give them even an inch, they'll take a mile, and we'll lose control in days."\n\n"We'll consider it." Speer flatly stated, placing the phone face up on his desk. Schörner's continued rant went unnoticed in the commotion that followed.\n\nIn a moment, the Gang began to shout over one another in their objections. Cries of "Murderer", "Pig", and "Idiot", which Speer decided to assume were directed at Schörner, rebounded through the room. Speer's face remained unmoved. Finally, Speidel stood, and the rest of the men silenced themselves.\n\n"My Führer, I think you should hear me out before you make any choices on the matter. I believe your council has a suggestion as well, judging by that... outburst." Speidel stated. The Gang, led by Schmidt, voiced their agreement."
speerflavor.6.a:0 ""Very well. Speak, Herr Speidel.""

speerflavor.7.t:0 "Speidel's Plan"
speerflavor.7.d:0 "Hans Speidel took a deep breath. Each of the men around him watched his every move, his every twitch. He made sure to minimize any nervous fidgeting before he began.\n\n"My proposal is similar to the Field Marshal's proposal, though I will say it is more refined than the blunt solution my colleague provides. In short, there is no way that this situation can be dealt with in such a. . .heavy handed way, if you wish to keep casualties low. However, if we negotiate, we give in to the slaves and their threats. Every slave in the Reich will see us give in and assume that they can do the same. We'll see revolts across Germany within a month if we give in, mark my words."\n\n"You coward! What you suggest would take far too long to do. The news will be all over Germany by the time your plan is ready, and then-" Schörner shouted to make himself audible through the phone. Speer paused for a moment to listen before motioning for Speidel to continue, placing his hand over the speaker to muffle the noise.\n\n"My suggestion would be to take a slow, cautious, yet tough approach on these slaves. An infiltration, coordinated with our best units, could potentially result in catching the rebels off guard. If we do this right, we could seize control of the factories without too much bloodshed. My top men have already begun drawing out a plan, if you wish for it."\n\n"You idiot. You're ruling out even trying to negotiate because of what you think will happen? You're no better than the butcher on the other end of that telephone." Schmidt loudly objected. The rest of the Gang nodded, though their reaction was much less strong than that of Schmidt.\n\n"I'm not suggesting we go in and kill all of them, Helmut, I'm suggesting we put this down before it spreads!" Speidel wheeled around angrily. A shouting match erupted before Speer, with a hearty slap of his table, brought everyone to order. He sighed before turning to Schmidt."
speerflavor.7.a:0 ""Herr Schmidt, the floor is yours.""

speerflavor.8.t:0 "Schmidt's Proposal"
speerflavor.8.d:0 "Schmidt stood, the rest of the Gang watching him closely. He cleared his throat before he began, making sure to stand as upright as he could. Speer watched him intently as he began.\n\n"My Führer, while the other proposals that your generals have brought before us could certainly hold some merit, the fact remains that they are simply too harsh to be considered. If we pull off any form of military maneuver against the slaves, the liberals you rely on so heavily will explode. After all, would such an oppressive maneuver not directly contradict your supposed wish to free the slaves? No, if you wish to come out of this with your hide intact, you must come to the table with the slaves. This doesn't mean we have to give in to all their demands, of course, but a negotiation would certainly go down well with your base. Besides, while Herr Speidel seems to think negotiation would encourage revolt, I believe it would have the opposite effect. After all, would the slaves not believe you truly mean what you say if you talk to a revolting group?"\n\nSchörner's voice cut in at a volume loud enough for all to hear. "You traitor! You imbecilic fool! You think the slaves can be negotiated with? You think this WON'T encourage lawlessness? My Führer, I cannot stand with such a ridiculously stupid action!"\n\nSpeidel uncomfortably cut in on Schörner's continued rant. "While it pains me to say it, I have to agree with Schörner on this point. Negotiation, as I said, only breeds further revolt. To give in is to set the precedent that we are willing to give in to violence and chaos. We'll only see unrest if we give in for stability's sake."\n\nSchmidt did not take this rebuttal lightly. "You only think this because you're too wrapped up in discipline to see the human side of things! We're running out of time to make a decision here, my Führer! If we don't negotiate, blood will run through the streets of Frankfurt, and our claim to reformism and slave freedom will be forever damaged!"\n\nSpeer sat in silence for a moment, running through all the possibilities he could think of. The men in the room stood silently, waiting for a reaction that could change Germany forever."
speerflavor.8.a:0 ""We must be strong. Herr Schörner, do what you must.""
speerflavor.8.b:0 ""We must be moderate. Herr Speidel, do what you can.""
speerflavor.8.c:0 ""We must be true to ourselves. Herr Schmidt, do what you will.""

speerflavor.9.t:0 "Do What We Must"
speerflavor.9.d:0 "The room, which only a second ago was nearly bursting, now flipped to uncomfortable silence. Speer became keenly aware of the stares of disbelief, rage, and disappointment that bored into him. The only noise now was the crackling of the telephone. Speer could even imagine Schörner staring into his receiver in shock.\n\n"Of course, my Führer." Was all that Schörner said before the line went dead with a loud click. Immediately, total chaos consumed the room, quickly rerouted into the lightning rod of pure rage that was Helmut Schmidt.\n\n"You goddamned MADMAN! You just killed 200 innocent souls, you heartless bastard! What sort of reformist are you? Free the slaves, huh? I didn't realize you meant freeing them from the fucking mortal coil!"\n\n"You will show respect to my decisions, Herr Schmidt. I am still your Führer!" Speer rose from his own chair in anger. Schmidt refused to sit down, despite the worried taps on his thigh by Kiesenger.\n\n"You shut the hell up, you two-faced rat! What will the people think!? What will the international community think!? Did you put an iota of thought into this before you chose death for hundreds?"\n\n"Herr Schmidt, you shall not insult me, and you certainly shall not tell me to shut up!"\n\n"I couldn't care less what you say-" Kiesenger shoved Schmidt hard, and the man caught himself. Breathing deeply, Schmidt paused for a moment. His voice strained against his restraint as he continued. "I think it would be best if I retired for the night." With that, Schmidt left the room. The rest of the Gang closely followed, stopping only to glare at Speer, undoubtedly holding their tongues.\n\n"Herr Speidel, I made the right call, you must understand. The Heer can't think we're going too far, and the conservatives would shred me if I didn't. . ." Speer trailed off. Speidel said nothing, instead briskly turning and exiting, leaving Speer to reflect on his own decision."
speerflavor.9.a:0 "One must be forceful in their action."

speerflavor.10.t:0 "Do What We Can"
speerflavor.10.d:0 "The room processed Speer's words for a moment. A small grin spread across Speidel's face, a frown crossed Schmidt's, and various looks of acceptance flashed across the Gang's face. Slowly, Speer turned to the phone, which now sat deathly silent on the table. All eyes turned to the receiver, as the men braced for the explosion.\n\nAfter a moment, Speer grew concerned as to what Schörner was up to. "Herr Schörner, did you catch what I said?"\n\nThere was another moment of long, uncomfortable silence. Finally, the tinned voice of the Field Marshal returned. "Loud and clear, my Führer. Know that I am fully against this half hearted weakness." The line shut off with a menacing click.\n\n"My Führer, thank you for seeing reason. I promise you, we will not disappoint you in our endeavors. We'll have results shortly." Speidel turned and exited the room. Speer could almost envision the gears clicking away in Speidel's head, turning fiercely as he began to work on the problem at hand.\n\n"My Führer, while I can't say I'm in support of this measure, I will say it's a better choice than what you could have done. I hope you'll have mercy the next time one of these situations crop up." Schmidt spoke quickly and curtly. Speer could detect a hint of frustration in the man's voice, but said nothing in return. Finally, Schmidt left the room. Each of the other Gang members shared their own thoughts, none particularly positive, before departing. Speer sat alone in his room now, leaning back as he tapped his fingers on the desk. He turned to the window, the night sky sprawling over the Germania skyline. He exhaled a breath he had barely realized he was holding in. To nobody in particular, he said-"
speerflavor.10.a:0 ""I think I handled that well.""

speerflavor.11.t:0 "Do What We Will"
speerflavor.11.d:0 "The room, which had been almost bursting with sound, went dead silent. Speidel's eyes shot to Speer in disbelief, Schmidt's eyes widened, and the rest of the gang's attention quickly shot directly to the phone. The moment of silence would not last for long.\n\nThe telephone on the desk, which had been almost forgotten about in the chaos, quickly grabbed everyone's attention with a screech of static. Schörner's voice, now almost as loud as if he had been in the room, exploded from the speaker so ferociously that the phone nearly rattled off the table.\n\n"My Führer, you can't be serious! Are you truly suggesting that we not only put down a rebellion, but negotiate with them? They're slaves! If we negotiate, we give into decadent, lesser races! We give in to those we own! Do you honestly think that the other slaves will look at us give in to a slave revolt and not get the idea to do the same?"\n\n"Herr Schörner, I've thought this over, and this is the obvious solution if our agenda is to be followed and believed. Besides, your solution is less of a fix and more of a massacre." Speer flatly replied. The look on his face clearly betrayed his opinion on the Field Marshal to the other men in the room.\n\n"My solution may not be weak enough for you bleeding-hearts, but it will work! I cannot, in any way, support such a foolish, naive choice-"\n\n"Well, Herr Schörner, I'll take your complaints into consideration." Speer spat as blandly as possible, before unceremoniously placing the phone back in the receiver. Almost immediately, he was beset upon by Schmidt, who spent the better part of the next 5 minutes praising Speer's choice before rushing from the room, quickly being followed by the gang. Speidel stuck around a little longer to give his thoughts, mostly cautionary words against excessive looseness to revolters, though Speer could tell he was holding back some of his more choice words.\n\nFinally, when everyone was gone, Speer leaned back in his seat and stared out of his window. He couldn't help but think of the fiery speeches against him that were sure to come from all sectors. It was certainly going to hurt him with the Heer and the conservatives. Indeed, he almost regretted his choice for the amount of problems it would open up. At the end of the day, though, at least he knew it was the moral one."
speerflavor.11.a:0 "Schmidt can get it done."

speerflavor.12.t:0 "The Invasion"
speerflavor.12.d:0 "It had been almost a day since the siege had begun, and there seemed to be no end to the standoff. Mykyta watched from the factory window as his fighters patrolled the barricades, weapons in hand. It had been a very busy 24 hours, but it was certainly some of the most exciting of his entire life. He noticed Mikhail coming up as well, and sighed at the loss of his peace. Mikhail had been jumpy the entire time, pacing the factory for hours.\n\n"What's up?" Mykyta asked Mikhail. Mikhail said nothing, instead lighting his cigarette. Mykyta waited a moment for a response.\n\n"It's not that something's happening, it's that nothing's happening. No negotiation, no infiltration, they're just waiting for something." Mikhail exhaled.\n\nIt was at that moment when an explosion rocked the barricade in front, sending men flying across the compound. In an instant, all was chaos. Gunfire filled the street as Wehrmacht soldiers, dressed in full battle gear, charged the factory. The slaves put up a fight, and both Mikhail and Mykyta saw their fair share of Wehrmacht soldiers fall, but any hope of the attack being repulsed ended when a Leopard, machine guns spitting lead, rolled over the remains of the barricade. Its gun blasted a high explosive shell directly into wing A, blowing apart the flimsy walls of the factory like a house of cards being hit with a sledgehammer.\n\n"Mykyta, I think this is the end." Mikhail said quietly, as more and more vehicles began to overrun the factory. Mykyta was silent for a minute, watching the end of his dreams. The revolt had ended not as he hoped, but as he expected. Now, all that was left was to go out in as much a blaze of glory as they could."
speerflavor.12.a:0 ""Tell Rasmus. Execute the hostages. All of them.""

speerflavor.13.t:0 "The After-Action Report"
speerflavor.13.d:0 "The room seemed to fit the mood of those inside it very well- dark and cold. Speer sat behind his desk, the Gang sat in their assorted chairs, and Speidel stood. All of them sat in uncomfortable silence, processing the news they had heard.\n\n"Well. Herr Speidel, you have the numbers, correct?" Schmidt took the liberty of starting the conversation, obviously not wanting to let Speer control what was said. Speidel stirred uncomfortably at being prompted by Schmidt, clearly catching on to Schmidt's plan, but went ahead anyway.\n\n"Numbers are incomplete, but, ah, we currently have about 191 slaves confirmed deceased, with about 100 more in custody with various wounds. Wehrmacht casualties are about 35 confirmed KIA, with one armored car disabled- hit by a Zhdanov. 62 have reported wounds, mostly minor bruises and scratches."\n\n"And, out of the estimated 70 hostages they were holding, how many did we recover?"\n\nSpeidel paused, hesitating to read the result. Finally, he spoke up. "None."\n\n"So that makes, what, about 300 dead? 300 innocent souls lost. Incredible. If only there was some other way we could have gone about this operation-"\n\nSpeer spoke up firmly. "Helmut, we've gone over this. I am not going to-"\n\nHelmut raised his voice over Speer's. "If only we could have negotiated, or taken any other means of attack that wasn't rolling a fucking tank over them!"\n\n"Herr Schmidt, I'm warning you-" Speer raised his voice in return. Schmidt ignored him, instead raising his voice to a near yell.\n\n"But no, this was clearly the right choice, right? 300 dead, but-"\n\n"Herr Schmidt, you are dismissed from this meeting!" Speer yelled angrily, and the room fell silent again. Slowly, Schmidt packed his folders and left, the Gang quickly following. Speidel left a few seconds afterwards, leaving Speer to reflect on his actions."
speerflavor.13.a:0 "Schmidt's words rang through his head, over and over."

speerflavor.14.t:0 "The Student's Response"
speerflavor.14.d:0 "It started out as a trickle. State media, of course, would not be covering such a stunning thing as a slave revolt in full detail (instead framing it as "minor unrest") so the information was passed through word of mouth. Telephones around Germany rang with the tales of gunshots, tanks, and machine guns rattling off, leading to many in universities across the Reich becoming glued to their phones. In Frankfurt itself, students watched from their windows as tank after tank rolled over university avenues and roads. It soon became apparent what they were here to do.\n\nThe massacre may have been ignored by the press, but it certainly wasn't ignored by the people. The telephone lines from Frankfurt nearly jammed with the sheer volume of calls sent across the Reich. In universities from Cologne to Königsberg, the youth of Germany heard uncensored, unfiltered accounts of chaos and death, directly caused by the government they had supported and trusted. Their reaction to the news was as one would expect.\n\nWithin two hours, spontaneous protests had erupted across any city with a major university in it, grinding the streets to a halt.\n\nWithin three hours, the protests were riots, and the police was backed up by whatever Heer forces were on hand.\n\nWithin five hours, the streets were lit by the flames of burnt-out cars and broken Zhdanovs, and the air was choked with tear gas and smoke.\n\nWithin eight hours, the streets were empty once more, leaving those who had cleared them to pick up the pieces. One thing was clear, though- the student's faith in Speer had shattered, and it was doubtful he could ever regain it."
speerflavor.14.a:0 "Was it all a lie?"

speerflavor.15.t:0 "The Legends of Frankfurt"
speerflavor.15.d:0 "The newspaper sailed over the barbed wire on the wall with ease, falling to the ground outside of the slave barracks with a quiet thud. The early morning mist had dampened the paper somewhat, but it didn't matter to Mateusz, who reached out of a crack in his window to pick it up, sliding it into the cold barrack before slamming the window shut again. As he pulled the rubber band off the roll, he could only thank God that one of his friends had managed to strike a deal with a group of sympathetic students. It had let him and his fellow bunkmates stay informed, a luxury that many fellow workers did not possess.\n\nAs his friends gathered around him, he flipped through the first pages. It was the standard news, mostly, until he hit the fourth page.

I never thought I'd see the day." said one man behind him. "Christ, it says they put them down. Wonder what that looked like." said another. "Brave motherfuckers, the lot of them.

The slaves in Frankfurt had enough of the whip and the baton, and they rose up, and you know what? They succeeded. They may have been put down, but they took over their factories. These men are the first to challenge the Germans, but they will certainly not be the last."\n\nHe took a breath, the men hanging onto every word.\n\n"And, hell, if they revolted against their guards and succeeded-""

speerflavor.17.t:0 "A Job Well Done"
speerflavor.17.d:0 "Speer's office was missing one member- an uncommon occurrence. Each man in there- Speer, Schmidt, and each of the other members of the Gang- watched the door patiently, awaiting Speidel's arrival. Finally, almost 20 minutes after the meeting was supposed to begin, Speidel made his way into the room, carrying multiple folders and dropping them on Speer's desk.\n\n"Sorry for my absence, my Führer, but the action report came in later than I expected. I hope you'll forgive the wait." Speidel breathed heavily, finding a seat as soon as he could. It seemed as if he had gotten some exercise in his rush to the office.\n\nSpeer flipped through each folder, searching in vain for numbers. After another few minutes of silence, he sighed and flipped the folders shut. "Forgive me, Herr Speidel, but I can't find the actual report in this mountain of paperwork. Can you give us a run down?"\n\nSpeidel grinned- he had done his paperwork, and expected this to happen. "Of course, my Führer. The operation began in earnest at 12:30, concluding at 13:43, though most of the action was finished by 12:42. In this period, 104 revolters were killed, with 187 captured and placed in custody, including all four of their supposed leaders. Wehrmacht casualties were 11 KIA, 24 wounded. Out of the 83 hostages taken, 74 were rescued. Overall, I think it's clear that this was a success."\n\n"Well, hold on there." Schmidt rose to his feet. "Sure, the operation succeeded in its goal, and I'm sure we're all thankful for that. But over a hundred people were still killed- lives that would have been saved if we had negotiated."\n\n"Herr Schmidt, I understand your concern, but I don't think many are weeping for unruly slaves." Speer replied.\n\nSchmidt stared at Speer, ice in his eyes, before sitting back down. The meeting would conclude shortly after."

speerflavor.18.t:0 "The Student Reaction"
speerflavor.18.d:0 "While much of the Reich had been paying at least passive to attention to the drama unfolding in Frankfurt for the last days, none watched more intently or cared as deeply as the students. For the last three days, students in every major university were glued to their phones, waiting for their friends to relay new news from Frankfurt. From there, they would speak to their friends, who would spread it across their dorms. Through this jury-rigged communication line, the students stayed up to date on every movement, every development, every shot. All watched intently for Speer's response- perhaps this was the turning point for him to finally kick up slave retribution to a new level.\n\nTo say that the reports of Wehrmacht storming the factory disappointed and angered the students greatly would be an incredible understatement.\n\nAs the news spread throughout the cities of Germany, so too did the protests. University dorms emptied onto the streets as thousands of enraged students marched on a scale not seen since the chaotic days of '63. Various protest chants filled the air, each different in sound and lyrics, but they each revolved around one theme- betrayal.\n\nThe streets would eventually empty, of course, but the feeling of resentment lingered. Across the Reich, portraits of Speer were silently taken off walls. Posters espousing Speer's ideals slowly disappeared from college campuses. In every campus, the tone of political discourse shifted from idealistic dreaming to bitter disappointment, as once again a leader had betrayed the youth of Germany.\n\nPerhaps it was not as bad as it could have been- a straight invasion of the complex may have driven the students to a riot- but the damage was clear. Speer had let the students down, and never again would they trust him so blindly."
speerflavor.18.a:0 "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction."

speerflavor.19.t:0 "The Trial"
speerflavor.19.d:0 "The judge rapped his gavel twice, leaning forward to give his final remarks. The audience, hypnotized by the spectacle of it all, leaned forward with him. Indeed, the only four members of the court that seemed untouched by the spell were the defendants, who stared daggers into the judge's robes.\n\n"I believe this court has heard enough. Through the course of this trial, we have heard tales from witness after witness of these slave's brutality. They rose up against the order of things, took arms from the workers of the factory, made hostages of any who dared resist their takeover, and when the time to restore order to the facility came, they brutally murdered numerous brave sons of our Reich! I'm truly saddened that the worst penalty that I can give to these heartless pigs is DEATH, to be executed immediately by firing squad!"\n\nThe crowd roared its approval, and the boos came fast and heavy as soldiers hoisted the slaves to their feet, beginning to drag them down the hall and out of the courthouse. Suddenly, one wriggled free. He pushed past the guards and, in one loud yell, shouted something that silenced the room. It would not be published in the news reports the next day, nor would it stop the crackle of gunfire that occured in the next minutes, yet it stuck with those who heard it long after the other details of the trial faded from their memory. After all, there was only one thing that it could mean, and if the slave spoke the truth, then what would the next years bring?"
speerflavor.19.a:0 ""WE WILL BURY YOU!""

speerflavor.20.t:0 "The Negotiator"
speerflavor.20.d:0 ""What are they doing?"\n\nJan held his binoculars tightly to his face. Next to him, Mykyta watched as well as he could, though the action was currently happening well down the street.\n\n"I have no idea." Jan replied. "There's a man in a suit- he's talking to the army right now- they're setting up speakers?" Jan looked over to Mykyta in near disbelief.\n\n"Are they negotiating? You can't be serious." Mykyta responded, a similar look in his eyes. The Germans, negotiating with slaves? Untermensch? It didn't happen. Besides, why would they? Mykyta and Jan would never say it aloud, but they knew that, if the Germans really wanted to, they could steamroll any resistance the slaves could put up. Why would they negotiate?\n\n"You must be seeing things. Give me the binoculars." Mykyta snatched the binoculars from Jan's hands, pressing them to his own face. True enough, he watched as the man in the suit argued with a flustered officer. After a few moments, the man in the suit grabbed a microphone and began to stride forward. A stately voice blasted from the speakers, engulfing the factory.\n\n"Good afternoon!" the voice boomed. "My name is Helmut Schmidt, minister of foreign affairs and lead diplomat of the Reich! I have come to discuss terms of surrender, so that none may die on this day. With your co-operation, we can come to terms. Without it, the end result of this affair will be more bloody than either you or I want it to be. If you wish to cooperate, send a sign." With that, the man retreated back to the police cordon.\n\nJan and Mykyta looked at each other again. A mix of disbelief, joy, and relief permeated through each of them. Perhaps they could succeed after all."
speerflavor.20.a:0 "Incredible!"

speerflavor.21.t:0 "The Treaty of Frankfurt"
speerflavor.21.d:0 ""I'm telling you, Herr Schmidt, we can't accept that. We want to be free. There is not a compromise between freedom and slavery."\n\nHelmut Schmidt leaned back in his chair, resting the bridge of his nose between his fingers. "And I must tell you that I'm working with limited time and space here. You don't know how hard I needed to work to even get this chance. To release you, after a violent uprising? No, it would never be allowed. I need you to work with me here."\n\n"Then perhaps I will remind you, Herr Schmidt, that we still hold numerous hostages."\n\nThere was silence for a moment, as both parties regarded each other. Though neither side could read the other's mind, both knew that they couldn't afford for the negotiations to fall through. For Schmidt, it could spell the end of his reputation. For the slaves, it could spell the end of their lives. There had to be a compromise somewhere.\n\nA bolt of inspiration struck Schmidt, and he took his chance. "Look. I can't release everyone, but perhaps I can hit a middle ground. My proposal- you and the rest of your leaders surrender, and we try you fairly. The rest of the slaves are freed, along with the hostages. If you take the deal, I promise- none of you will ever see a slave factory from the inside again."\n\nThe slaves looked at each other. Schmidt attempted to hide his distress- were they sharing looks of joy? Agreement? Distaste? He needed a result soon- no doubt that Speer was getting antsy at how long it was taking to strike a deal.\n\nThe two men on the other side of the table looked back to Schmidt. "Herr Schmidt, if what you say is true, we would be happy to accept imprisonment if our comrades go free. I'm sure the other leaders would feel the same."\n\nThe prisoners couldn't see it, but the tension of the last days evaporated from Schmidt's body as he rose to shake their hands."
speerflavor.21.a:0 "A miracle!"

speerflavor.22.t:0 "The Briefing"
speerflavor.22.d:0 " Schmidt and the Gang entered the room all smiles, Schmidt himself carrying a healthy number of papers. Speidel passively watched as Schmidt carefully set them in front of Speer, who began to look through them. Midway through the first one, he stopped, looking back up to Schmidt. "Herr Schmidt, I'd prefer to not be looking through these all day. Is it possible for you to give a summary?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "Of course, my Führer. I flew to Frankfurt and engaged in a dialogue with the slave leaders. Over the course of the next days, we spoke to one another at the negotiating table, concluding in an agreement where, in exchange for the freedom of the hostages and the surrender of all arms, the leaders, and the factory, we would let the slaves go free-"\n\n"Hold on." Speer interrupted. "You let all the slaves go free? As in, all of them?"\n\nSchmidt paused for a moment. "Yes, my Führer. It was the only way to a successful deal."\n\nSpeer sighed. "Jesus Christ, the Heer is going to fucking shred me, Schmidt. Do you understand? The conservatives, the militarists, the buisnesses- they're going to fucking shred me."\n\n"My Führer, it was the only way." Schmidt replied, his tone of voice hardening slightly. He attempted to continue, but was again interrupted, this time by Speidel.\n\n"May I interrupt, my Führer?" Speidel questioned. He continued before he got an answer. "While the intentions of Herr Schmidt are certainly in the right place, I fear that we may see a wave of revolt among the slave populace when they learn of our softness on this issue. We need to stay on guard, perhaps raise security on major factories."\n\nNow Schmidt was the one interrupting. "For God's sake, Speidel, are you still going on about this? Your solution would have killed a hundred people, probably more. Sure, there could be some unrest. Does it truly matter if we've saved lives?"\n\n"I'm not saying it was the worst choice- there were certainly worse solutions proposed. All I'm saying is that we need to be on guard."\n\nSchmidt threw his hands up in the air. "My Führer, all of the details are in the folders. I'm sure you can find them for yourself." With that, Schmidt departed, with both the Gang and Speidel following shortly. All that remained in the room were Speer, his thoughts, and the mountain of papers on his desk."

speerflavor.23.t:0 "Letters From the Reich"
speerflavor.23.d:0 "To our great Führer, Albert Speer\n\nMy Führer, we of the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Club for Albert Speer in specific, and the United University Clubs for Albert Speer in general, cannot commend your actions regarding the slave rebellion in Frankfurt higher. Indeed, there was some concern that you would go back on your word regarding the freedom of all slaves when the news was first passed to us. When the news came through that not only had you sent Helmut Schmidt to negotiate with the slaves, but had succeeded in your goals, I can only describe the mood as ecstatic. Indeed, we can certify that in Germania, we held an impromptu rally in your favor that was attended by at least a thousand fellow students. Such rallies were also reported to us by our other chains across Germany. We are so thankful to have a leader who truly is backing up his promises, and we are certain that this chain of action will continue. Know that, no matter what forces try and stop you, we will always be behind your rule.\n\nSincerely, Rudolf Wagner, Head of the United University Clubs for Albert Speer.\n\nTo the Führer, Albert Speer\n\nOne cannot help but look at your recent choice to negotiate with slaves, the bottom tier of German society, with disdain and fear. We in the Heer worry greatly over this recent course of action- is it not true that we Aryans are superior to our slaves? If we treat our slaves like Aryans, then what will the meaning and the power of the word even become? Suffice it to say that many of us in the Heer are more than a little displeased with this recent change in actions. Such foolish measures as negotiating with slaves will only lead to trouble and western corruption in the future, and the notion that this western corruption may be infiltrating even the highest levels of our government is very worrisome for those who love our Reich and what we have built upon it. I can only implore you to change course immediately, before the nation which we all love falls to bolshevism and decadence.\n\nSincerely, Oberst Hans Meyer, Commander of the 2nd Regiment, 36th Division."
speerflavor.23.a:0 "At least it's mixed."

speerflavor.24.t:0 "Aftershocks"
speerflavor.24.d:0 ""I told you it would happen, my Führer, and it has. Read the reports for yourself." Speidel dropped a folder, filled with paper, directly onto Speer's desk. Speer took one look at it and, already knowing the contents, sighed deeply. Schmidt watched on, repressing his own anger at Speidel's continued resistance.\n\n"Hamburg- Two guards dead, six slaves dead, a dozen wounded. Danzig- Four guards dead, six slaves dead, another dozen wounded. Munich- 14 guards dead, 25 slaves dead, dozens wounded. The list goes on and on, my Führer." Speidel spoke with the certainty of a man who had memorized these reports. Speer placed his head in his hands as Speidel continued. "It seems clear to me, and many others, that this was a poor course of action to take, and now we are seeing the results."\n\nSchmidt cut in. "Herr Speidel, when will you stop going on about the damn decision? I think it was a net positive."\n\n"Of course you do, you came up with it." Speidel spat. He turned to face Schmidt, who seemed to grow angrier by the second.\n\n"And you say it isn't because we turned your proposal down!" Schmidt pointed at Speidel, who remained unmoved. "We avoided a disaster by negotiating- can you imagine the international response to us gunning down slaves? What about the students and reformists- you think they'd agree with running people over with tanks and cars?"\n\nNow it was Speidel's turn to get angry. "Herr Schmidt, it is your choice, not mine, that has led us into this mess! We would never see slave unrest to this scale if we had not enticed them to do so!"\n\n"ENOUGH!" shouted Speer, his head snapping back up. "What's done is done! There's no use arguing the damn point! If I hear one more argument about what we should or could have done, I'm throwing both of you out of my office!"\n\nThere was silence for a moment. Both Speidel and Schmidt were caught off guard by Speer's outburst, when he usually was the only one to remain calm in these scenarios. Finally, both men exited the office, leaving Speer alone to ponder what could have been, and what his actions would mean for Germany."

speerflavor.25.t:0 "Fresh Blood"
speerflavor.25.d:0 "Antonin Grzywacz was not fit for this kind of work. Forced to stay on his feet for hours on end, assembling car part after car part, and even sometimes hearing the crack of a whip and a pained yell that would always accompany it shortly afterwards. Life was not easy in Łódź - at least, that's what it used to be called. Now it was called Litzmannstadt, which the 47-year-old man found to be a horrific butchering of one of Poland's cities. Yet he could do nothing about it. Only toil and toil, until his body gave out.\n\nOne day, the piercing shriek of the whistle that would signify the beginning of their shift was absent. In its stead was a deafening gritty voice that came over the entire factory. In his time of servitude, Antonin had learned German and was practically fluent in it, which made understanding what was being said easy enough. It seemed to be an announcement of some kind, and as he listened in, the fingers grasping the assembly line tightened.\n\n"Workers of the Reich!" The voice exploded. "Listen carefully! On orders of the Führer, today we will begin introducing two things. The first will be an overhaul of the factory. It will chiefly concern an increase in safety protocols," he said, and Antonin cracked a discreet smile. Since when did they care? "Some of you will be receiving advanced training regarding new equipment being brought in. Next! You will be working with a few Germans--" ... What? The- "Who have been designated as being highly disciplined, efficient, and with a strong work ethic." As if the monstrous Aryan knew anything other than bloodshed, Antonin thought, a sudden fit of anger overtaking him. "It will be in your best interest to cooperate with them, else the punishments for acting out on your beastly instincts will be extreme!"\n\n"That is all. Continue working." As the crackle of the voice faded and the whistle signalled the beginning of the day, Antonin saw several men walk into the building. Unmarked. He scowled to himself, but he was no fool. The Germans settled themselves in, but the rest of the day passed with a silence that barely contained the intense murderous aura that surrounded many of the Polish slaves working there. Even Antonin. But he wouldn't succumb. Even in this scum-sucking bottom-of-the-barrel life, opportunity would come. For what, he didn't know, but he knew he couldn't work himself to death in here. Not yet."

speerflavor.26.t:0 "Fraternizing With the Enemy"
speerflavor.26.d:0 "That day, he felt particularly tired. Rubbing his eyes as he passed the checkpoint into the factory, Antonin floated a thought in his head about calling off from work. But, no - this wasn't Poland; they'd only accept a delimbing as an excuse, and even then. With a hiss laced together by a sigh, he noticed that a slight adjustment in workers was made. This happened every few months, of course, but this time luck proved unfavorable towards Antonin. Walking into the factory, he should've expected it sooner or later. But actually seeing the man - not particularly outstanding in any way, not even possessing the desired traits of an Aryan like blonde hair, was a thought running through his mind long enough for him to hear a shout behind him. It was the harsh voice of a factory overseer that grazed his back which called him back to him senses, and with an awkward neck rub, Antonin went to his designated position.\n\nHe was no fan of the Aryan, that much he could say for certain. His dislike of the man next to him plagued his mind. What an insult for a German citizen and a Polish slave to be working side-to-side like this! Antonin's mind drowned out the noise from the outside world as he thought, filling him with frustration about this awful fact. It was only when something akin to a voice came through did his haze stop up and lift. Then he heard it again, more clearly this time. "Hey, ah..." The other man began. Antonin tilted his head to the left slightly, enough to denote that he was hearing, but also continue to stare at his work. "You're Antonin, right? That's how your name was listed." No response. It took several seconds before the German continued. "I'm Gottfried. I've just been thinking... if I'm going to be working here for a while, I might as well-" That's when Antonin decided to turn all the way, giving him a cold glare. "No talking on the job." He said, almost spitting venom. "What sort of 'discipline' do you have to be doing this?"\n\n"I..." The other man began, seemingly wanting to say something. Then he turned back to the assembly line, muttering, "Nevermind, then." The German backing down from a conversation struck Antonin as strange. Why did he even bother to engage in conversation in the first place?! Did he not know who they were, and who he was? He didn't bother to think about it any further. By the time the whistle rattled through his head, all Antonin wanted to do was sleep. Sleep for as long and as heartily as he could."

speerflavor.27.t:0 "This Land is Your Land"
speerflavor.27.d:0 "He was 49 years old now, and things have changed significantly ever since that announcement two years ago. This transitionary period was marked with relative calm - the incidents where non-Germans would assault Germans was rare, and it only got rarer when rumors spread of what would happen to those that tempted fate towards their overlords. Having spent most of his waking days here, he knew it all inside-out. That's how he also saw, bit by bit, how his fellow Polish workers were being phased out. At the very least he knew this time around where they were going.\n\nGottfried wasn't one of those 'highly disciplined' Germans, he had come to learn, instead being a volunteer for the Reich's program of encouraging them to move into less populated, more diverse cities nearing the edge of the border, rather than staying inside overcrowded metropolises. If only he could visit one of them. But discussing these things with Gottfried served as the second best thing.\n\n"So, Antonin," the German began, barely paying attention to the assembly line as he worked. "Have you heard?"\n\n"No, Gottfried, I have not." Antonin responded.\n\n"Führer Speer has decreed Polish slaves-" Antonin winced lightly before glaring at him, whose eyes widened in slight surprise as he nodded. "Ah, um, I'm sorry-- workers will be allowed to, uh, in due time, leave their assigned job and return to the city that they were born in. Or, if they were born in a village, in the city closest to that village."\n\nAntonin almost couldn't believe the words he was saying, causing him to fumble with the car part in his hands for a moment, threatening the gaze of a nearby overseer, before he readjusted and continued. "I'm sorry, Gottfried, but I don't believe your government is so kind to do that. There's always something in it for them." He said, bitterness pouring in near the end.\n\n"Well, I suppose that is... true..." The German said, very warily, very hesitantly. "But think about it. What does that mean for the future? Perhaps more liberties would be afforded to you at home?"\n\nThe thought of such a thing made Antonin chuckle. "Sure, Gottfried. When they eventually kick me, a man nearing fifty, out of the factory, what will they make of me when I return to a city I don't belong in, as a man well past the point of usefulness?" he asked.\n\nGottfried began to open his mouth, but relented. There was nothing more to speak about this topic for today."

speerflavor.28.t:0 "Embers of the Past"
speerflavor.28.d:0 "Antonin's fiftieth birthday was today. These days were no different from any other. Only a reminder that his body would continue to break down and become less useful, and that his mind would dull with the passage of time. For that morning he brought a slightly worn-out coat to work, and passing by the checkpoint, noticed an aura distinctly different to how it usually felt. When he entered the factory, Antonin noticed that all the workers were congregated into a half-circle around a podium in the middle of the room. Fitting into the crowd of half Germans and half Poles, Antonin stared at the collection of what looked like military officers, one standing in front the rest. Subconsciously gritting his teeth at the sight of a proper Nazi, Antonin listened in as the man gave a stiff salute. And then...\n\n"Workers of the Reich! In this case, I am more importantly addressing our Polish slaves."\n\nAntonin rolled his eyes. Of course.\n\n"The Führer has announced that the Litzmannstadt automobile factory, property of Daimler-Benz, is letting go of all Polish workers who have not been born in Litzmannstadt!"\n\nImmediately, the murmuring in the crowd was heavy, but a slamming of rifles against the ground by nearby soldiers shut them - and Antonin - up quickly.\n\n"Effective today, those in question will be given three days' worth of rations, their documents, including a passport, and one month's work of pay. You will be guided to trains that will head either to German territory, or to the Polish government." Feeling a need to say no more, he gave another stiff salute. "Dismissed!"\n\nAntonin's mind had entered a flurry. Was what Gottfried said that year ago really going to ring true? Was he going to go home? Why now, of all times, and so suddenly?! There was a tightness in his chest as he approached the man he had now known for two years, and for a moment, he had looked at Gottfried as if he was just another German, but it passed just as quickly as it appeared.\n\n"Y-you were right..." Antonin began, and his fellow worker nodded silently. "Now I must board a train and head to a city, all in one day. This all has happened so quickly, so suddenly, and..." He trailed off.\n\nGottfried shook his head. "I don't know much, Antonin, but I know that I'll miss talking to you." Antonin looked at the German carefully, swallowing a lump in his throat."

speerflavor.29.d:0 "The wooden flooring made his behind sore, but it's not like he could complain. The train car's door in front of him was open, exposing the endless green that swirled past him. He didn't know what to think. What was there to think? Nothing at all. Indeed, that was what Antonin was going through. He thought of nothing, but his mind hurt as if he had a migraine. Perhaps he was not allowing his mind to think? Yet deep in that hole of nothingness and despair, a thought was extracted. He could notice his breathing becoming more hitched, the scratching of his fingertips against the floor as his hand tightened up.\n\n"I have been here before," the sentence wandered in his mind. Numb and cold, but it held an ingrained sense of impossibly comprehensive fury. "I have been here before," it repeated, begging to be completed. "The rumbling of this engine and the mixing of the colours in front of me. I recognize this all. It's familiar to me, in a way I cannot ever forget." And how could he? If he did, he would lose the last thing that made him a person. Otherwise, he would simply be a shell, hollow and tumbling in the void, waiting to be consumed by reality's cruel whims. "I have been here before. When I was, I never expected to be anywhere else. But I did. Now I have returned."\n\nAntonin was not thinking. How could he think? If he did, it would only open up long-lost memories that he would not dare to look at. Here, in this train, he was alone. Utterly alone. In this car there was nobody else but him-- he had all reason to think, and all the time. But he would prefer to have his mind remain closed. Banishing the flame that threatened to engulf him in his mind, he only stared mindlessly into the fields, all of which blended into the same field, green and endless.\n\nYet even in a lack of thought he hated the chugging of the engine - the bumps in the rail making him stop up his breath as if the ride had ended. Silence dominated his surroundings, but all he could hear was noise that was almost thirty years overdue. He did not feel the pain in his fingertips, nor the fact that everything in his vision blended into shapeless blobs and whirlwinds of color, and the grinding in his mind that lasted for hours, and hours, and hours..."

A symbol of oppression removed - but it meant nothing to him. In fact, it only served to further frustrate him. Every day after he would come home from work, into a small apartment that can barely house one person, Antonin wonders what really would happen now. Clearly, this was not the end goal that the Germans had intended for him, as Gottfried had implied. But what then? What else was in store for him and his people?.\n\nOne day, the piercing shriek of the whistle woke him from a daydream and alerted him to work. He was dreaming so often nowadays - was that age, or simply a want to escape reality? Either way, work was monotonous as before, only with somewhat less oversight from the guards, who seemed willing to pounce on any opportunity to harass them before. If life had to carry on like this, perhaps it wouldn't be so awful. He had a place to live, and a steady supply of people to talk to, as well as walking around a city freely... even if it was tamed by the Aryan, and moulded in its image.\n\nAt least, those illusions of which lasted until a fellow worker spoke to him. Surprised to hear a voice, he observed who spoke to him - it was a woman, who seemed to be in her 40s.\n\n"You," she began, with Antonin listening in only passively. "I can tell that something is off with you. Like a pacified animal, you shamble about and wait to be put down. Is that right?"\n\nThat caught his attention immediately, and he hissed out: "Are you ridiculous? What are you saying?"\n\n"What I am saying is this: I can sense that you are empty, my friend. That you have wanted something which has been kept from you for a long time."\n\n"And what would that be?" He silently struck back, frustration already appearing on his face.\n\n"An opportunity," she said, and a small smile graced her lips.\n\n"An... opportunity?" Antonin repeated, the word echoing in his head. Was that not what he was looking for? In all his years of labor, he never once struck a German in fear that he would miss out on an opportunity. And now... ?\n\n"To take back what we've deserved for so long. You know as well as I do, don't you?" She asked, as if she was speaking of some long lost artifact. "Say it. That alien word that has been stolen from us for decades.""

speerflavor.31.d:0 "Grigory had always carried the hate passed down from his father. There was a spirit in him-- unconquered, unbroken, unwilling to bend to the will of the Aryan scum. But he had nothing to show for it, only working day-by-day to toil himself and serve as a slave to the Germans. If that's all he would be, and remain to be, then it was almost better to simply cease to exist. The thought to grab the nearest metal object and rush a guard crossed his mind, but never in the years he was working there did he carry out that glorious fantasy. Perhaps he was a coward for doing so, and would always remain a coward.\n\nUntil one day, a shrill voice stood tall over him and the rest of the non-Germans present in the factory. He didn't understand much of their language, choosing to almost actively work against learning it, but he had still learnt fragments of it. Enough to learn and piece together one crucial fact: that the first German worker would come work here, beginning that shift.\n\nEven though the silence afterwards spoke for itself, the guards didn't motion for any increased vigilance. Instead, they seemed to show relief that their fellow brethren would work here. Grigory, however, had other ideas. Only minutes afterwards did the first workers began trickling in, and once they did, the light in his eyes had shone in a way previously unknown. He could tell what the sinking yet exciting feeling in his gut was. This was the time, and he could get no other time.\n\nPerhaps it was the fact that the guards were lax from the German workers, perhaps the other Russians and Poles and Ukrainians decided to ignore the fact that Grigory seemed to tense up as if he'd seen the murder, and perhaps the German that was approaching him mistook his feelings as fear rather than fury. What was for certain, however, was the chaos that ensued when Grigory grabbed the nearest metal object, screamed in a voice coarse and unused, rage overfilling every inch of his body as he swung harder than he'd ever swung before.\n\nThe sickening crack that echoed through the factory was quickly drowned out by shouts and bootsteps, with the German falling to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut as Grigory unrelentingly continued. It took no less than six men to tear the murderous machine away from the man bleeding profusely on the floor, and only minutes later did silence come over the factory once again.\n\nWhen tomorrow arrived, there was one less slave working in the factory."

The silent corridors and empty offices were an almost eerie sight, long shadows cast by the moonlight and pitch-black corners, but a single light dispelled the ominous atmosphere: Helmut Schmidt was still in his office, working on the latest diplomatic documents, when he realized he had long since past the closing hour. He was very tired, and perhaps just a bit tipsy from the liquor he drank to keep himself awake. With a yawn, he turned off the light and looked from the window at the sleeping Germania: how different it was from Hamburg, so big, so strange!\n\nStill thinking about his home, he made to leave the office, but perhaps by chance, he looked at the mirror near the room's entrance, and wished he had never done it. His figure was dark, but a single moonray illuminated the very thing that he didn't want to see: the red band with the swastika, symbol of all members of the NSDAP, including him. Disgust crept from his feet at that cursed thing and at himself for wearing it every. Single. Day. He immediately went to remove it, as if it burned, but stopped when he heard a voice.\n\n"Why are you trying to remove it?" his own reflection told him, sneering in the dark mirror, "You can't lie to yourself, you like it, admit it!"\n\nAfter a moment of complete befuddlement, he replied, anger flowing from his voice: "I don't! I'm doing it for everyone! To build a better tomorrow! I'm- oh, no... no, no, no!"\n\n"Liar" the shadows replied as they took shape behind him, a severe visage so similar to him.\n"Fa-father?"\n\n"Look at what you have done, Helmut" Gustav Ludwig Schmidt said, disappointment heavy in his aged features, "You live among them, smile at them, shake their hands! You betrayed us! You are no son of mine!"\n\n"I- I'm doing it for-"\n\n"Liar!" screamed his father, "Liar!" laughed his reflection, "Liar! Liar! Liar!" cried a thousand shadows swirling around him.\n\nWith a loud crash, the mirror went into pieces when Schmidt threw his briefcase at it, and suddenly the spell broke. Trembling, crying, the diplomat looked around himself in fear, but only silence met his gaze. He fell to his knees, hugging himself, repeating the same phrase as if it could shield him from everything."

Those Slavic scum across the border of Militärbezirk Russland were unifying, preparing themselves for an invasion of Germany and the destruction of the Aryan race. Until that time came, the Feldmarschall would have to contend with grimy Russian partisans in the cities and the wilderness.\n\nThat was why he was there, after all. Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner and his brave allies were conveniently carted off to this snowy shithole by the blessing of the magnanimous Führer, where they would serve the Reich by protecting the Eastern Front from whatever insane faction managed to unite Russia. Schörner plucked the cigarette out of his mouth and spat onto the snow. He didn't know whether to be furious or flattered at being granted such an exile.\n\nThe nest of vipers that was Germania could never have prepared him for the disgusting Militärbezirk, where the German and Slav practically skipped through Moskowien hand-in-hand. What was the point in hunting down terrorists, training troops and securing the eastern border if such degeneracy was allowed in the cities? The Feldmarschall shook his head and took another puff. It was only a matter of time before miscegenation was legalized in this territory. Militärbezirk Russland deserved new leadership. Someone with the strength and courage of Schörner, with the loyalty and obedience of Remer, and with the determination displayed by their militarist clique. As for the leadership of the Reich...\n\nSchörner smirked bitterly to himself and threw his cigarette into the snow, where it hissed back at him. He stomped on it with his jackboot and set off towards his men."

speerflavor.34.d:0 "He was hardly expecting this day to come. Since when did the Reich take this direction... ? Under the new Führer, Abel figured. Fighting outwards from the Rhine and towards Germania during the tumultuous civil war taught him a thing or two of how things could so quickly change, and how the New Order can be just as volatile and prone to collapse as any other country. Though... those things did not concern him tonight, as he waited until the clock would turn to a new day, and then he would begin the preparations.\n\nA hundred men was, perhaps, overkill, but it guaranteed the approach he was going for; a swarm of trained soldiers surrounding the facility would let them know that it was pointless to put up a fight. It was... funny, really, he thought - these same methods he despised were now the methods he was actively using to make sure no blood could be spilled, though unlike his superiors, he made sure to consider the fact that the slaves also deserved this protection. With a sigh, he brought up the megaphone near his mouth as he nearly arrived to his destination. It'd been an hour since the operation began, so he was sure everything was in place. Thinking otherwise would make him needlessly worried.\n\nIn front of the large building dominated by lights and action, an armored vehicle bearing the flag of the Reich came driving casually towards the checkpoint. Seeing something like this happen at such a late hour roused suspicion, though the guards made no moves as the vehicle stopped up in front of the facility, and a man stepped out, dressed in the colours of the Heer and bearing a megaphone in one hand. With a click of the device, it came to life, and Abel took a deep breath.\n\n"This is Hauptmann Richard Abel of the Heer speaking. To all personnel guarding this factory, and to all the slaves working in it, this is a declaration of the Reich." The guards seemed confused. "As of tonight, this facility, belonging to IG Farben, has been seized by direct orders of the Führer, and will be transferred over to ownership of the government. Any attempt to fire upon the soldiers we have stationed nearby will be seen as an attack upon government troops, and will be treated with extreme contempt. The security personnel present and off-duty will be relieved of their work here, and are to be escorted out of the building effective immediately." He gave a short pause to see how they would react, and upon seeing the guards freeze up and understand the message, Abel continued. "That is all." The light crackling static of the megaphone abruptly ended when he shut it off. His job here was done."

Before, he couldn't bring himself to do it, but now, after having gone through the same song and dance three times in a row with Abs' mercenaries, he was to confront his actions, and the actions of who he was serving. He'd been in that cold, cold place for so long now that the dawn of a new day began to trickle in, sunlight piercing windows and beaming on barely-worked assembly lines and hollow slaves. He should have left an hour ago, he thought.\n\nBut he didn't.\n\nThere was no armband, he could tell. Well, one that didn't bear the six-pointed star. They were all gone now, and Hauptmann Richard Abel's stomach sunk. The deeds of twenty years ago finally caught up to Europe, and where was he during that long, long time ago? When the world was on fire and he was a match waiting to be lit and thrown in, he got his opportunity to strike the flame when he, and only he, encountered something that would make or break a soldier under the banner of Aryan superiority. Abel could still remember it, clear as stars in a pitch black sky, his focus on the real world fading as his mind began to wander.\n\nIt was a family of three, a woman and her two children, though he could hardly remember what any of them looked like. They lived under the house of a Ukrainian man, right on the Donbass river. He didn't speak Ukrainian and nor did the man speak German, but something about his desperation when Abel hit the butt of his rifle against the wooden floor caught him off-guard. The begging and pleading that still stuck in his mind made him relent. There, in that house, were no comrades of his back then to just shoot the degenerate Slav. Instead, he was given a choice. Would he do his duty to the Reich? Then he would be congratulated as a Jew-hunter. And what if he left them be? Then he would surely hang as a traitor to the Aryan people. It felt like an eternity before something happened - but eventually, Abel knew the path that he would take.\n\nNow he stood here, surrounded by cigarette smoke, a veteran fighter of Germany, serving for almost twenty years. Things have changed oh-so-much. He wouldn't call his country reborn, no, but the winds of change blew another direction. Yet..."

Before he was out of the apartment, however, Erich heard him say, "And please, live a little."\n\nIt was another dull day at work. Nothing but the management of files, sorting it by the alphabet, and the long hours spent by a typewriter. From the windows near his cubicle, Erich caught a distant glimpse at the figure of Germania. Its paved roads, its Roman-style boulevards, and its almost grotesque dedication to maintaining a faint link towards a fake, imaginary past. The memories of the slave camp haunted him, not just in mind, but in his body.\n\nHalting the clacking motion of his hands, he stared at his fingers. Slender and thin, bony and almost dry, like teeth gnawing on the typewriter's buttons. He was still fragile. On a whim, he crossed his fingers together and cracked them. The words came back to him.\n\n"Please, live a little." Wessel said. No doubt, he had seen the state of Erich's apartment. Dusty, messy, dirty, and dingy. Erich had known from the start that rejecting the RND's offer would mean death for him.

He spun it in his hand, letting its long and slender body insert itself to the various gaps between his fingers. His eyes stared off into the distance, and he paid no attention to the briefing. Erich was the single agent there. The room was plain and dull, but that was understandable. Rows and rows of white, artless, and stark metal desks and chairs - with only one attendant present. A whiteboard with a map of Monowitz was before him.\n\n"Hey, Herr Fischer," the briefing instructor said, annoyed by Fischer's antics, "are you paying any attention?" He was the same as the receptionist in his hotel. Greying, boring bureaucrats in an endless waiting line for something to do. The Reich's Aryan hierarchy seemed to be an environment where men like these could live, thrive even. As opposed to the blond, eternally youthful, and blue-eyed models seen in countless propaganda posters - Erich had seen his share of those. He would tell you that none of it was accurate.\n\n"I've been there," Erich said, "done that. Why don't we make a deal, Herr Instructor." He leaned forward on one hand, putting his pencil down. "You tell me what to do, straight to the point. That way, we can get our jobs done without much more contact with one another."\n\nThat seemed to get some rise out of the man. "Deal, but one condition," he held his index finger up as if to emphasize the point he was making, "I don't hold any responsibilit-"\n\n"I got into the job knowing the risks, sir. I would not be a field agent otherwise."\n\nIgnoring Erich, the man proceeded, "You are to infiltrate the Monowitz slave camps and gather intelligence, as before. With one twist," the man pointed on the map, with pointless irony, "once you're in there, you will be contacted by an RND element within the camps. He will give you the equipment to proceed to your second task. Sabotage the camps and provide suitable conditions for the RND to trigger a slave revolt there."\n\n"Sounds easy enough."\n\n"I appreciate your sarcastic wit.

Once upon a time, a few months ago. The scent of sweat had formed a layer of briny smell, sickly sweet, and saltily bitter. Erich had once passed an eternity in here, but thankfully, he had a place to sit this time. Others were not so lucky. Some collapsed under the heat of a hundred bodies pressed together like sardines. Erich knew that some had died.\n\nInside the cramped, damp, and dark atmosphere of the carriage, he drew a picture of Monowitz from memory. There were the pens, the guard barracks, and finally the chemical plant. An eternity would pass, but he held onto the picture like a man clinging to driftwood amid a shipwreck. Soon. Soon.\n\nThe carriage halted, its tires screeching as it entered its port. Its doors slid open with full force, and early morning light poured into the gloom. Those who had survived the journey filed out, carrying whatever their fate had spared them to have. Erich's possessions were not much. Papers and some clothes - just enough to get a skilled laborer permit into the more humane portions of the camp. Not that that was much to speak of.\n\nThe camp's guards assembled them into two groups: one for men, one for women. Then they lined them up, and an officer sorted both ends into skilled and manual labor. Ahead, in Erich's queue, a man dressed in the most opulent uniform possible in this place flicked his fingers. Left. Left. Left. Right. Erich had heard the stories of where the left side had led to. He shuddered. He hoped his papers were enough.\n\nWhen Erich's turn came, the man's fingers flicked. Right. Erich had never breathed a greater sigh of relief. Next were the showers: a comparatively more relaxing place to go to.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Erich's old life had vanished, and only darkness awaited ahead."

 speerflavor.40.desc:0 "The guards of Monowitz treated skilled slaves with a little more respect than manual ones. For example, Erich did not have to huddle and sleep in pens containing hundreds - thousands even - of slaves. He had a cell of his own. He was supposed to bunk up with nine or more slaves, but his companions never arrived. It was either fate or the RND's intervention. It could be both, really.\n\nFor the first weeks, Erich worked under the alias of one Herr Hermann Dach, a supposed specialist on the operations of the chemical tools they used here. Of course, Erich knew jack about the details of his work. Then again, he would never have been a field agent if not for his expertise in the arts of mimicry.\n\nIG Farben did not go easy on its slaves. Returning to his cell, he threw his body onto the thin slice of mattress they call beds and slept. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he found, served on a platter, an enormous piece of bread. Erich's mouth watered, but its purpose was probably as both a meal and a signal to commence the operation. He tore into it, piece by piece, not wasting anything, not even the crumbs.\n\nAt last, he found a key and a map. Stopping his surfeit of ravenous appetite, he put the rusty iron key to the platter and unfolded the map. It was small, barely the size of Erich's two hands put next to each other. It was enough. Drawing Monowitz's floorplan from memory, he correlated the X on the map with a secluded corner of the yard. He turned the browning, barely consistent piece of paper over to see if he had some more information to work on.\n\n"You have 45 minutes."\n\n~P\n\nErich made for the prison cell door as quickly as he could."

The X mark glowed like a single speck of starlight in the map of Monowitz within his mind. When he reached it, he dug with his hands. The dirt seemed surprisingly loose, crumbling readily to his grasp.\n\nIn a minute, he found a black backpack buried under all those refuse. The RND had not abandoned him. He was relieved. The last time they sent him deep undercover, they did not give him anything. Erich had to perform on-site procurement for practically everything that he had needed. He was in no hurry to extend his stay at Hermann Abs' personal slave labor camp. Unzipping the bag expectantly, he peered to see what treasures lay within.\n\nErich found a tidily folded uniform, closely matching those worn by the demons of this man-made hell. A pistol with a silencer accompanied a belt stacked with a few magazines. A bolt cutter was in there as well. In a few seconds, the bag had transformed him from the fortunate but ill Hermann Dach to the most dangerous agent of the RND. A handwritten note at the bottom of the bag said:\n\n"240 minutes."\n\nIt would have to do. Donning the uniform, gun, and equipment, Erich Fischer set out, the best agent the RND has ever had.

Erich had to be quick about it: in a camp as large as Monowitz, there was bound to be a lot of slave pens. Sabotaging one might be easy, but dozens of them would prove to be quite the task.\n\nRows upon rows of identical, brown barracks stretched out in front him. Erich had reached his quarry. Before him were shabby figures shambling in the shadows, laden by exhaustion and fatigue. Their silhouettes made pity rise in Erich's heart. After all, he had been here before. His ribs poked out from his uniform - an eternal reminder of what he had undergone in the name of the Reich.\n\nUnpacking his equipment near one of these brown buildings, he set to work. Taking out his bolt cutter, he set out to do his task. Erich looked at his watch. With a little luck and elbow grease, as the Americans say, he'd be all right."

Perhaps whoever behind the notes had once been an intelligence officer themselves. Their work certainly showed prowess and a penchant for executing dangerous gambits with verve and panache.\n\nHis lungs craved the puff of a cigarette. It had been too long. A week? A month, perhaps? Erich's mind had lost any semblance of time that had gone within the camp. From dawn till dusk was work, work, work. These places were not used for labor alone, but also for extermination.\n\nHe did not believe in the racial theories spat out by the Reich's bureaucrats and politicians. If they had spoken the truth, there would be no need for institutions such as these. There was no nobility in slavery. If the Fuhrer had not been paying Erich's paycheck, he, too, can fuck off.\n\nThe time had come for a decision. The briefing had outlined the goals that Erich needed to pursue in his time working within the camp. He could follow that directive, but he could make a run for it - and no one would blame him.

Whoever solitary guard he encountered dressed well, their evil permeating through the clean fabric and cloth they wore. Erich felt out that this place did not belong here: a spot of order and sanitation within the bowels of the most inhumane organ of the Reich.\n\nWhile he stood there, awestruck by the first signs of civilization after months (or was it weeks?) of captivity, a greeting came, from somewhere ahead. "Good evening," someone said, an innocuous phrase that shot tendrils of surprise and shock through Erich's spine. At least he did not look out of place, and his disguise worked. Returning the greeting, he strode out of view as quickly as he could. Erich was not there to test his luck. His next ordeal would require every ounce of subterfuge that he possessed in his bones, and he was not about to waste it to the indiscretion of these people.\n\nThe ammo storage was his objective. P's help with the patrols would not avail him here. He was alone, and the uniform was the thin line that separated him from discovery and danger. His clammy skin clung to it desperately, holding on for dear life. The time had come to test the value of the RND's investment into its equipment."

Here, there was no languor, no lapse in attention on the part of the guards. There was no lack of firearms on the site. The solitary guards that Erich encountered before had handguns, but here, they sported rifles and submachineguns. Above, a sniper perched on a tower beaming with a spotlight, ready to pick off anyone that came near. Erich may have a handgun, some clips, and a steady hand, but frontal assault can only lead to a single end. Death.\n\nStaying out of sources of light, he reconnoitered the ammunition storage. Perhaps more information would help. The guards here would be more discerning than the ones he had passed by on his way here. It would be awkward with the two guards at the front if he saw through his disguise. There was no telling if they would let him go or shoot at him. Erich would need to trust in the RND's preparations to pass undetected. He did not want to trust them, owing to the incident a few months ago, but he would have to, to make it out of there alive.\n\nA third path was open to him, however. He could, instead of following the RND's directives, leave. No one would blame him for his sense of self-preservation; he had completed one of his objectives anyway. So his choices towered over him, as the spotlight came close to highlighting his position. To advance, or withdraw?"

His uniform did not pass muster, and he hoped to the Lord that his gun's firing mechanism would not jam on him. The ammo cache shrunk, as the feasibility of reaching it grew smaller and smaller.\n\nHis first instinct was the make a run for it. A stupid notion. The rifle and submachine gun can nail him at this distance without much effort. He had only one way, one path to survival. Like in the American Westerns he loved so much, his hands must be nimble and his fingers ready on the trigger. He drew his gun and fired.\n\nThe first shot caught the rifle guard on his eye, sending him spasming to the ground, lifeless. The second round found the submachine gunner's heart, halting him on his tracks, as he slowly collapsed to the ground, drowning in a pool of his own blood. Before Erich could revel at the work of his reflexes and skill, however, a gunshot rang out from the tower. A bullet whizzed past his head, kicking up dust and dirt behind him.\n\nFiring whatever ammunition he had left in his pistol at the sniper, Erich broke into a run.

If he falsified his reports, no one would know. He would walk free, a man who had attempted his best to accomplish his mission for the Reich and its Fuhrer. He would be a hero.\n\nHe walked towards the entrance of the camp, through the gates where the head guard selected which slave was a skilled worker and which wasn't. If Erich strode out of there, he would never face selection again. Avoiding any source of lights, he dodged patrols and slaves walking and hobbling in the shade. It was miles from here to an RND headquarters, but the walk was worth it. He had done his work. It was time for him to find a life that existed beyond the dangers of his job. Maybe he'll start a family, and finally settle down.\n\nHe smirked, and then laughed, voicelessly, silently. He was free. Free from the manipulations of shadow masters, from the political intrigue that had so often put his life on the line. Erich felt a longing in his lungs, a craving for cigarettes. He saw no reason not to satisfy it."

As a truck driver, his days were subject to a lot of random occurrences and events that may happen on the road, but today was satisfying. There were no roadblocks, and the traffic was silky-smooth, uncreased and uninhibited. He parked his truck near the gates of Monowitz, and chose that moment to sleep a bit, missing the cacophony that arises deep from within the slave camp. He did hear the blaring of sirens manifesting as insistent whispers of alarm, but he dismissed it. The guards would handle that\n\nA knock on his window, then silence. Then a thud, again and again. The window breaks with a shattering ring, and a man dressed in shabby guard clothes forced the cabin open. "Out!" he said, "get out!" At first, Leopold intended to resist, but meeting the muzzle of a submachinegun head-on takes a caliber of a man that Leopold wasn't. He dragged Leopold's body out, as the scream of sirens reached a fever pitch, and shouts of alarm seemed to get closer and closer.\n\n"Get down!" Leopold dropped and lied on his stomach, perfectly still. He heard the truck's tires screech, its engines hiss and whine as it shuddered awake. Leopold closed his eyes, and the muzzle flashes seemed to penetrate his eyelids. He felt his ears ring, even though he had covered them with his hands. The noises faded, and silence settled.\n\nLeopold rose to a kneeling position, and said, "Did he get away?""

Having sabotaged the locks earlier, it swung inwards smoothly enough, its rusted hinges making a dreadful creak for every second of the process. Erich's guard uniform was now shabby, riddled with close calls, and steeped in his blood. He thought about suicide, the cyanide pill close to his side, residing in his pouch. Whenever he wanted to, he could bite into it, and let the poison work its way into his system.\n\nHe decided that it'd be too easy. Erich gritted his teeth. His fingers traced the contents of the pouch slung on his hip, feeling for boxy magazines that contained bullets for his submachine gun. There was one and only one. His laughter mixed with the oncoming shouts of alarm and the blaring of sirens. Somewhere, someone screams, and eddies of sobbing made his way to this barracks, Erich's bubble of quietness. For the first five minutes, it was tranquil, almost peaceful. Erich did not believe in God; his Catholicism was mostly for show. Yet, he felt an urge to pray, to repent, at the very last second. He shrugged it off.\n\nAs if on a rote habit, Erich unlatched the empty magazine from his MP5K, and loaded a fresh, new one. His hands cocked the firing mechanism, priming the gun. He trained his sights on the door and waited."

A few weeks ago, he had traversed his way inside, not knowing whether or not he would emerge on the other side alive and well. Yet, he did. The weeks passed by in his mind: befriending his fellow skilled slave laborers, and whiling away the hours spent in pain and exhaustion with nothing but a spirit that refused to die here. Erich's memories seized him, and he stopped in his tracks, trying to push it all away.\n\nMonowitz was something personal. Erich had not wanted to go there, not at all. However, he was sure that the RND would not protect him from his enemies or even try to assassinate him. Erich was sure of it. He had accomplished whatever he was sent here to do: to facilitate a slave uprising in the Monowitz camp as best as he could.\n\nYet, he stared at the looming, bulbous chemical plant that threatened to swallow the whole eastern side of the camp. What he had done - sabotaging the locks, and rigging the arms cache to blow - was in the name of necessity. This one was personal. If only he could make it in, Erich's one remaining explosive would ensure that whatever volatile chemicals inside it would burn the plant down.\n\nHe only needed to decide whether or not to do so. It was risky, but perhaps it was worth a try."

Once he was left alone, he planted the bomb and set the time - something he was running out of. Any minute now, the charges Erich had placed within the arms cache would explode, and that would be an awkward position. He walked outside with alacrity and panic bounding within his gait. Any minute now, any minute now.\n\nHe said farewell to the guards that kept watch over that place, saying that the equipment was kept to satisfactory standards. One of them chuckled and said that he would beat the slaves senseless if they hadn't. He turned his back on them, and his walk turned into a trot, before accelerating into a gallop at the quickest pace to the nearest forest. It was a very close-run thing, and Erich did not turn even after the camp exploded and burnt behind him\n\nReaching the edges of the woods, Erich looked back and saw the fires rising high to the night sky, almost like a second sun.

Erich slipped and fell face-first into the linoleum floor, the lights in the ceiling closer to his eyes than if he had stood. He dragged himself by the steeples of his fingers, his arms fighting on where his legs had failed.\n\nErich was going to die here. There was no question as to his survival. He was sure that one of his organs had malfunctioned, and his pain-addled mind was struggling against an inevitable shutdown. Propping himself up on the side of a desk, he felt his bag for traces of the bomb. Taking it out, he examined the square package. No bullet had managed to destroy it, and he marveled at the miracle. He pulled the safeties out, and set the timer to the quickest. He won't be able to run. Erich smiled, through his blood-stained teeth, but he will wait.\n\nWhen the charges set the factory alight, Erich's body had crumpled to the ground, lifeless."

 #IG Farben HQ infiltration
 speerflavor.48.t:0 "Briefing"
 speerflavor.48.desc:0 "Erich set his pencil down and looked around him. Rows upon rows of stark, artless, and utilitarian white metal chairs and desks - yet there was only one attendant. The room was as plain as its contents. A single, rectangular lamp at the center, and a blackboard with the map of the IG Farben's Headquarters before him. He felt a compulsion to review his notes, something new to him. Rifling through the yellow-tinged, neatly-lined pages of his notebook, he read it with a kind of indolent alacrity.\n\n"Any questions," the briefing instructor said, "Herr Fischer?" The man giving him the lay-down was the very picture of Aryan vitality. That is to say, the types that the Reich's racial hierarchy helped survived and flourish. Bureaucrats with nothing to do but to endlessly recount past data and extrapolate into the future, all to no avail. Like lines washed away by the waves. If Erich were to be honest, he hated them.\n\nOn this occasion, however, he found their fastidious, annoying attention to detail useful. Even idiots with no sense of initiative and foresight could find work in the RND. "Say," he said to the instructor, keeping the tone as level and cool as his head, "can you summarize, briefly, what I am to do here? We both know we need to get back to work quickly, so the sooner the better, sir."\n\n"In brief, what you are sent there to do is to intelligence gathering," the instructor said, pointing pointlessly at the map, "but the risk is incredibly high. If IG Farben were to discover you, the RND has never had you as its employee."\n\n"What kind of intelligence?"\n\n"Account books, implications of customer abuse, violations of the labor laws, that sort of thing."\n\n"Sounds like a dull assignment."\n\n"Oh," the man seemed struck with Erich's cockiness, "I assure you, nothing about this assignment is dull. Now, Herr Wessel has granted you a lot of leeways to choose your moment. When will it be?""

 speerflavor.49.desc:0 "The headquarters of IG Farben was a truly massive building, and Erich had a vague idea of how much Hermann Josef Abs wanted to drive the point home that he was a powerful businessman. It was barely illuminated under the pale moonlight, but the front of the building was fixed with a bright light, showing three guards, all armed with fully-automatic rifles, patrolling and standing guard. It was not as heavy security as Erich expected it to be, but then again, it was merely the entrance. The inside, he was certain, would be far less forgiving.\n\nHe was already fond of nature before, but he was even more fond of it when it allowed him to sneak from the side and crouch towards the front, thanking his training that allowed him to move quietly across the grass. When he got near the entrance, Erich sunk back into the shadows as a guard passed him by, and prayed to whatever deity was watching as he moved out towards were momentarily unoccupied as all three guards were to busy patrolling the street in front to pay attention to the man rapidly walking up the stairs and towards the set of glass doors.\n\nAlready his brow furrowed with sweat as the doors swung open and closed behind him with a silent, but still painful creak. Then his eyes flicked upwards and spotted the outline of a camera on the other side of the room, beginning to turn to where he was. With quick reactions, Erich leaped to the nearest pillar and dragged himself down it before sitting on his behind, letting out a sigh of relief. Already, he risked failure. But then again, he had no room to complain."

 speerflavor.50.t:0 "An Unreliable Lackey"
 speerflavor.50.desc:0 "There was not only one camera there, but two. Thankfully, after waiting for a few minutes, Erich managed to slip past both of them as he went up the stairs and climbed to the second floor of the building. The first, he knew, would not provide anything to him. The second, however, had the possibility of giving incriminating evidence. At least, that's what he was told. Opening a door, Erich listened in before moving into an empty office cubicle, getting down under the desk as his ears perked up. He wasn't alone in this place. There were more guards here. Two more, judging by the footsteps of one farther ahead and the talking of one closer to him. He let a minute pass before he moved out.\n\nErich knew that he wouldn't find anything in these cubicles, so he had to search for an office. When he crossed the short hallway separating one set of cubicles from another, he felt his chest tighten as one of the guards rounded the corner to the hallway he had left moments before. Had Erich been a second slower, he would've been caught. Circling around the large room, he spotted a few more rooms to the side, but one caught his interest.\n\nWaiting until the footsteps turned stiff and then turned silent off in the distance, Erich pushed open the glass door and read the nameplate that was on the desk.\n\n'RHINELAND REGIONAL OVERSEER'."

 speerflavor.51.desc:0 "The good news was that he had all the time in the world to discover what was inside the office. The bad news was that he had to look through the office, while also not drawing attention to himself. Erich knew the overseer's office had a camera in the corner, and every time it passed by him, he was tempted to bite his lip. The RND promised him that some cameras in the building would've been sabotaged - rolling the same footage throughout the night, as an example, which would give him infinite breathing room. They had even been so kind as to mark out which cameras were sabotaged, and which were not. All Erich hoped for was the Reich was wise enough to not underfund the agency's equipment. Oh, how he hoped.\n\nThe things he discovered during his tenur in the overseer's office was... quite interesting, to say the least. For everything related to the Rhineland, practically the industrial metropolis of the Reich, the numbers purported in several of the documents that Erich looked over... did not align with what IG Farben reported. In essence, what were lucrative trade deals and massive investments coupled with generous loans and promises of high quality products were all much less than expected. Such ideas would dig heavily into IG Farben's budget, but promising them would mean an injection of funds from the government, and an increase in business dealings.\n\nNot bad, Erich thought. They were effectively ripping off millions, and these papers could potentially mean at least a partial incrimination of IG Farben's staff. The question, however, remained.\n\nWas this enough?"

Even though he put his life on the line, at least the result would be dismantling an empire built on slavery. It wasn't Hitler's empire, but... the flicker of good came in steps at a time.\n\nThe moment Erich stepped out of the office, however, he heard something that nearly shot his heart from his chest. A loud, piercing noise that went from ear to ear, and then a shout. The RND failed to do what they were meant to do.\n\n"ALARM!"\n\nErich had to act fast. Any moment of hesitation and he would've been dead. Drawing his silenced pistol, he rushed towards the exit of the room and narrowly avoided one of the guards passing him by. They didn't hear his own footsteps while the alarm blared, it seemed. When Erich looked down the half-spiral staircase down to the lobby, however, he spotted bad news.\n\nTwo guards from the outside made their ways in, and both split paths up either set of stairs. Quickly, Erich huddled himself into the corner, pressing his body against himself as tightly as he could, and waited for the booted footsteps of a man with killing intent to pass by him and into the room he had just left.\n\nBrimming with sweat, he practically flew out of the exit, spotting a guard on the outside that was approaching the building. With a quiet shot that rang out in the night, the man yelled and fell over, bleeding from a leg as Erich made a mad dash into the trees that surrounded the building."

Erich had to move up further, and things wouldn't get easier from there. When he sneaked out of the overseer's office, he made his way to the nearest stairway, and spotted a guard standing like a stone statue near it. He was stuck from moving forward, and he had to act quickly, because the guard on the other side would be making his rounds to here, too - then he would be pincered.\n\nTravelling to a nearby cubicle, Erich spotted a book that hung off of the edge of the desk. It was a thick book, and Erich took a deep breath as he pressed down and heard it slam to the floor with a loud thud. Quicker than the footsteps he heard approaching, Erich returned and hid under the nearby desk, covered in darkness as he saw a pair of legs move past him.\n\nWith a deep breath, he moved his way out and practically rushed to the stairway, silently climbing up the steps and into the third floor. Here there were four guards, he could tell, and once again it was his job to find what he needed on this floor. Then, as he made his way to the right, he spotted it. A crown jewel."

Wasting no time, he hurried his way over to the office before any of the guards had a say in his actions, and made sure to neatly close the door behind him as he saw yet another camera flick back and forth. He put a lot of trust into the RND. Perhaps too much. With a sigh, he began to flip between pages, records, drawers, and the many other things in this office.\n\nEntire minutes passed. He was slowed down heavily by the constant footsteps outside, as he refused to risk entry by means of them hearing the noise inside. Eventually, however, Erich found out a strong curiosity that overshadowed what he had found a floor lower. Records that spoke about Abs' transactions; he was a rich man, perhaps the richest man on the globe, and Erich had a feeling that not all of his wealth was legitimate. Where Abs was supposed to pay the government hefty sums in taxes, he had found loopholes and falsified statements about his income, effectively slashing the money he had to pay to niceties.\n\nErich greedily took the documents with him, adding them to the collection of what he had already gathered previous. With these, he could make for a strong case against IG Farben, and for all intents and purposes, he had done more than enough. He had all the reason in the world to leave, but one piece of information still eluded him. The personal office of Hermann Josef Abs. Would he take the risk, bringing him into almost certain death, or would he remain content with what he had taken, and to return to the RND as capable and clever?

He was wide awake, and his senses on the ready. As he passed cubicle by cubicle, the sound of footsteps drew closer and closer, and Erich knew that more time spent waiting was more time for gaps of error to show. He had to act decisively, and he took a risk by looking out towards the hallway nearby to see if anyone was walking down, and there was. Moving back, he was thankful the guards were tired, as it seemed like that guard didn't notice him poking his head out. When he passed, Erich moved.\n\nThere was another door that he slipped by, and then a set of stairs. Dim, blue light and colorless concrete stairs were his only ally as he made his way up, passing by the fifth floor and then the sixth. Before he reached the seventh, however, there was a sudden conundrum. He heard more footsteps - this time coming from above him. Erich's mind was thrown into a panic for a moment, but he readjusted himself. He was expecting another person, but the guard was not. And so he got up the steps, standing right at the edge, when the guard rounded the corner. Right into Erich's grasp.\n\nWith a lunge, he wrapped his arms around the guard's neck and threw him to the guard, keeping him restrained with what the agency taught him, and using every muscle in his body that the RND forced him to develop. It wasn't difficult to overpower the man, and, after almost ten seconds, he felt him lose consciousness. Dragging his body to a corner, Erich continued moving upwards, knowing he was on a time limit that would kill him if it ran out.

The shrill noise of an alarm blared throughout the floor, and voices reverberated from the cubicles and hallways to him. "ALARM!" Was what Erich heard, and he felt a hint of betrayal. The damn RND said that the camera in the accountant's office was sabotaged, and he knew he hadn't been spotted by any of the guards. The ticking timer now turned into a bomb fuse, and Erich had only one way out.\n\nSlamming open the door with his elbow, he quickly made his way down the staircase, but encountered unpleasant resistance along the way. Fortunately, Erich shot first, and the guard only managed to fire one off-balanced shot that pained his ears as he fell on the ground. That would've attracted everyone else, he thought, and it did nothing to ease his worries.\n\nErich began to continue moving down the staircase - he would go to the first floor and pass through the doors in the lobby to the outside, he thought. Then he heard the door of the second floor creak behind him as he was halfway down, and Erich knew he only had moments to respond.

Paintings hung from the wall he could see, and while he was no art collector, Erich had a feeling they were quite valuable. Elsewhere, Hermann Josef Abs himself was present, talking kindly to two other figures. The first was Friedrich Flick, and the other was Edmund Geileberg.\n\nWith a puff of his cigar, Abs grinned. "Not to worry, dear friends. Speer and his pitiful Gang may think of us enemies, but we have influence abound. So long as we remain cooperative, things will go our way. As they had under the previous Führer." Geilenberg took in his words and spoke nothing, while Flick merely raised an eyebrow. "So certain of that?" He asked, and Abs shrugged. "I wouldn't trust these resources that we have pooled as of right now. I have some... connections that I can pull. Most importantly, extremely efficient and highly drilled troops that could do a variety of tasks. Defending, attacking..."\n\n"You mean to tell me you've hired a mercenary company?" Abs cut in, blowing smoke as he kept his smile. Flick looked puzzled for a second. "Well, they're not exactly a mercenary company-" Abs merely patted him on his shoulder, speaking with a cigar between his teeth. "We won't need any of those 'mercenaries' of yours, Herr Flick. We have our own, but thank you for the offer."\n\nIt was time for Erich to choose. In just a few seconds, he had to formulate a plan of action. To get in, get out, and get the hell out of the building. They were blocking the way, so he had to find some measure to dispose of them. And not only that, but the many guards patrolling the area would make it almost impossible to sneak in. Let alone the cameras. Maybe this wasn't the best idea.

 speerflavor.65.t:0 "An Architect's Blues"
 speerflavor.65.desc:0 "Another day, another cartload of problems... In his office at the center of the Reichskanzlei, Albert Speer, Führer of the German people, is tired; tired and stressed. Even after the war's end, there's no rest: the reconstruction is proving more difficult than predicted, and the party bureaucracy is already starting to resist the changes suggested by the Gang of Four. Like the proverbial clay pot, Speer feels powerless to act, a small raft engulfed by the stormy sea. Taken by the sudden need to escape, he stands from his chair and goes to the window: perhaps it will do him some good to gaze at the great Germania he himself designed?\n\nLooking outside, a wave of memories surges from Speer's mind, snippets of a life that was a mere decade ago, and yet feels as if it was another geological era: showing Hitler the progress made as the two friends laugh heartily, visiting construction sites, directing the workforce, and finally the Volkshalle's inauguration, the crowning moment of his life as an architect. It was a different age, one where the future looked glorious, not this... maddening quagmire.\n\nThe more he looks at what he built, however, the more a feeling of dread creeps over him: why is that building over there still unfinished? Why is that apartment block so bare, the slots for the decorations are all empty! More than anything, who is that incompetent who used low-quality stone for the walkways?! They are already full of cracks! As he finds more and more critiques, he also feels something else, a need he had not felt in years: he wants to correct those mistakes, to make them right, but even more, he wants something... new. His hands itch with the need to design, to give tangible form to the things in his mind! How wonderful it would feel to be once more, even if just for a moment, Speer the architect! However, what is an architect without his tools?"
 speerflavor.65.a:0 "Note to self: bring the tools to the office tomorrow."

 speerflavor.66.t:0 "Back to Work!"
 speerflavor.66.desc:0 "As everyone, except the security, leaves the Reichskanzlei, a single light is still on. In the Führer's office, there's still someone working for the good of the German people, or at least this is what the headlines will report, because putting a sign on the door saying "Architekt bei der Arbeit, Zugang verboten" would be a bit misleading...\n\nWith his work completed, the Führer can finally punch out, and let the architect take his place. Speer clears his desk and takes his tools out of the case he had brought from his home: they are old, but they still work, just like him, and that's more than enough! He has awaited this moment for the entire day, and as he looks at the large, empty sheet, he feels like a painter staring at a blank canvas, ready to fill it with his art: all kinds of ideas swim through his mind, from tall, bold skyscrapers to simple houses and small villas. With a trembling hand, he takes up ruler and pencil, and draws the first line.\n\nThe first sheet goes straight to the dustbin, followed by the second and the third. Trembling lines and small blunders irk the perfectionist inside Speer, but more than five years of inaction require some time to catch up. The fourth sheet, however, survives the initial scrutiny: in the end, he has settled on a public office, a classic of his old practise. As the jumbling mess of lines seemingly drawn randomly acquires purpose, and forms itself into the skeleton of a building, a smile creeps itself on Speer's lips: he is finally free from the stress, from the obligations, from the quagmire, doing what he loves!\n\nAfter a while, the architect stretches his arms and looks at his work. The essential frame, the easiest part, is done, now it's time to start the real work! He looks at his watch, and jumps: it's already past midnight! Best going to sleep, or tomorrow work will be a pain... As he goes home, however, he can't help but wonder: will his newest design ever become reality, or will it remain a small closet dream, one to be put in a museum after his death?"
 speerflavor.66.a:0 "I'm the Führer after all, I might as well be selfish for once..."

 speerflavor.67.t:0 "An Artist's Dilemma"
 speerflavor.67.desc:0 "The architect looks with satisfaction at his work. The foundations and the main frame of the building he has been painstakingly designing are done and ready to be built: from the quality of the concrete to the exact amount of steel bars needed to sustain the edifice, everything is specified with pinpoint precision in several side notes written in regular handwriting. Now, all it remains is the façade, and this is where the true challenge begins.\n\nWith a sigh, Speer realizes that he never bothered resuming his theoretical studies after he became entangled in the Rechtspolitik - trying to survive in a world where most of your "colleagues" want to kill you is, after all, quite the demanding task - and now he curses himself for not having updated his knowledge. How is he supposed to finish his new masterwork? What will be the final stroke on the canvas?\n\nLooking outside for inspiration, he sees once more his greatest success... with all its flaws and mistakes. Would it be best to follow in his own footsteps, and use the style that forged Germania into what it is now? To act as if nothing changed in the last ten years? For a moment, he thinks of the new, grand structures built in the United States, with their new lines and glass walls: is the future the way forward? To fully let go of the past and find a new beginning?\n\nWith a last look to the Volkshalle, a final thought enters his mind: what if a third way is indeed possible? A fusion of old and new, of past knowledge and future design, a melting pot where both ideals would have to make a small sacrifice for the sake of art... As the Führer-Architekt takes pencil and ruler once more, he has made his decision."
 speerflavor.67.a:0 "My craft is perfect as it is!"
 speerflavor.67.b:0 "Let us forget the past, for the sake of art..."
 speerflavor.67.c:0 "I shall pave a new way for future architects to follow!"

 speerflavor.68.t:0 "The Old Lion Still Roars!"
 speerflavor.68.desc:0 "Yes! All his art has always been for the glory of the Vaterland, and his new design will follow the same rules! With passion, he starts designing the grand façade: it will be a tall, large entrance way with stone walls and columns reminiscing of the Roman temples he so highly admired in his youth, with a staircase leading to the door. Who needs steel and glass, the strength and raw solidity of stone are enough to impress the viewer, just as it did ever since mankind learnt how to sculpt it into the shapes it desired!\n\nOf course, a public building required to always remind those who entered it of its function. The central pediment will sport a single, giant swastika overlooking the entrance, and atop the pediment a tall eagle will spread its wings over the German people, just as the Vaterland spread across the globe in the wake of its victories. Eagle's heads would regularly jut out of the walls, holding banners or other symbols of national socialism, praising the strength of the German nation and its many virtues.\n\nWith the finishing touches done, the architect looks at his masterpiece with satisfaction. He hasn't yet lost his touch after all! Finally standing and stretching his arms, he takes a last look to the great Germania, and finally, he sees it for what it is, his greatest success, perfect as it is! There is no conflict between architect and Führer, for both shall bring the Reich to new heights of power and prominence, as it was before, and as it ever shall be!"
 speerflavor.68.a:0 "Heil me!"

 speerflavor.69.t:0 "Out With the Old, In With the New"
 speerflavor.69.desc:0 "Looking one final time at the city he had designed from top to bottom, Speer finally realizes one thing. His ideals, his beliefs, his convictions are still there, they aren't gone, but he can see with his eyes how the first attempt at their implementation has gone: just like Germania, the Reich is a rotting corpse, and it will take a shock therapy to bring it back to life. One day, Germany will be once more at the forefront - no, it will be at the top - but only after sweeping changes have been accomplished. How can a small architect like himself change the tide with a pencil and a ruler?\n\nSlowly, his design starts to reflect his state of mind: the façade is clean, sharply cut, large glass window framed by black steel architraves, everything in stark contrast to the stone walls and colonnades of his own Reichskanzlei. As his building takes a shape so different from everything he has ever done, he feels a slight insecurity, like a child leaving his mother's embrace to swim on his own for the first time: he's leaving behind his old work, to create something he never thought to create, in a shape he never thought to give, so different from his initial plans; and yet, he knows this is what needs to be done.\n\nAs another evening turns into night, the architect finishes his work. With a last look to his old creations outside the window, and to his newest addition on his desk, Speer understands with painful clarity that he can no longer return to his old art: so much has changed in so little time, so much to learn, so much that he has forgotten. In his sadness, however, there's the seedling to a new relief: he's not done yet, there's one last thing he needs to do before putting his tools to rest.\n\nThe Reich will be born anew, a shining beacon of modernity! Perhaps it won't be the same Germany he had dreamt about in his youth, perhaps such a dream was never supposed to turn into reality, but he'll fight for his nation nonetheless, as he has always done."
 speerflavor.69.a:0 "The future is now, I guess..."

 speerflavor.70.t:0 "Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis!"
 speerflavor.70.desc:0 "As Speer reflects upon his choice, suddenly the truth dawns upon him. Didn't the Romans take the arch from the Etruscans? The columns from the Greeks? Didn't they study the Egyptians and their stylized forms? Yes. Did this make them any less Romans? No! On the contrary, they grew with everything they learnt, every new notion, concept, technique they absorbed! They didn't accept passively the foreign influences, but neither did they remain closed in their own little world: they assimilated all following their own criteria, everything put into the perfect place for it to shine brightest!\n\nThe solution, the breakthrough Speer needed is there! The architect resumes his work, his mind a melting pot. Slim, graceful stone columns hiding the steel inside them, just like his new Germany. Beautiful and proud, a steel gauntlet inside a velvet glove. The glass would take new forms, curved and elegant, fitting into the façade's fronton and reflecting the light into a majestic eagle holding the laurel of victory. A rainbow of colors, mitigated by the pure white of the stone, would marvel the visitors without scaring them, a comforting feeling of brightness and warmth.\n\nAs the first rays of morning relieve his tired eyes, the architect-turned-Führer can't help feeling satisfied. This time, perhaps the first in his entire life, he has created something entirely new: a new style, a new fashion! Perhaps it will never take foot, but it doesn't matter: an artist works for himself first and foremost, and he finally understands that he is, indeed, still an artist. Now, a new work awaits him, his masterwork, the coronation of his craft: to rebuild the Reich! To rebuild it into what it was always meant to be, a nation fully capable of embracing future without forgetting the past! As the cleaning staff opens the door and jumps seeing the Führer still inside, Speer greets them with a wide grin: this is a great day for Germany, the first of many to come! A new dawn, a wonderful dawn!"

 #Speer goes cray

 speerflavor.71.t:0 "Fissive Cracks"
 speerflavor.71.desc:0 "Benno Ohnesorg was dead. That news was already bad enough. What made it ten times worse was the news Speer got immediately following the murder, and he felt both disgust and anger rise in him when he found out.\n\nThe student movement grew a spine and the slaves grew consciousness. They had cast their die and crossed their Rubicon. Now they were not merely protesting, but also clashing with the police. In the streets of Germany, cameras rolled by state-controlled and underground journalists showing the mass panic that rippled through the cities, and the brutality exchanged between police and the rioters-turned-revolutionaries, stoked the growing fear across the nation. It was not received well by the public at large, but Speer received it worse. The slaves - and everyone else associated with them - needed to know their place.\n\nHe did not consult the Gang to make his decision. He had no need to - the next time he held his speech in the cold, dim Volkshalle, he made it clear. The streets would be filled with officers armed with guns. Live ammunition or otherwise. Silence dominated with the occasional approval from those who listened to him, and he met the Gang with cold silence - especially Schmidt, the brazen rat he had no patience dealing with. He knew what he'd say, and he didn't want to hear it.\n\nFor as many concessions as he gave to the pitiful reformist elements that backed him up for so long, he knew he could not disappoint his mentor by giving in to their every demand. It would only bring ruin to Speer's vision. After all, this was the Führer's crisis to solve."
 speerflavor.71.a:0 "And nobody else's."

 speerflavor.72.t:0 "Growing and Growing"
 speerflavor.72.desc:0 "Nothing was getting better. The Ehrentribüne was burning, and Speer could only watch. Clearly, the military police he had sent in did nothing to alleviate the anger the rioters felt. The rambunctious fools. The idealistic, short-sighted, animalistic fools. All they knew was chaos and panic, and here they were, burning down one of his most prized constructions. There were so, so many memories in that place. Glory echoed its field, but now it was empty; and did anything good come of it?\n\nPerhaps one thing. Speer's realization that these fools could not be dealt with in peace. He had given them a chance to take the olive branch, and they merely spit on his hand. Now he was in his office - and here stood a member of the Gang. "Minister of War, Henning von Tresckow." Speer coldly called, and Tresckow stood tall, unflinching, gazing at the Führer with an emotionless stare. "The Minister of the Interior is busy, so I'll pass this responsibility onto you. This revolt has gone too far. These madmen must learn what martial law is like."\n\nTresckow shifted uncomfortably. "Herr Speer, I-"\n\nNot a second more did he continue when Speer cut in, quickly and harshly. "That was an order, Henning von Tresckow, and you WILL listen to it. The time for playing games with your liberal demands is over. Germany burns, and I will destroy this alliance before I let this horde burn the rest down like the barbarians pillaged Rome. So I advise you to listen." He couldn't see it, but Tresckow's hands behind his back were clutching against each other tightly, and his finely-cut nails scraped against his skin in anxiety.\n\n"Alright, then." He said, giving a short nod. "Is there anything else you want me to do?"\n\nWas Speer looking at him or through him? He couldn't tell.\n\n"No, Herr Tresckow. I want you to focus all of your attention on this. They will learn the values of violence and discipline. The whip will crack, and..." Speer's fists trembled. "They will learn. As a Prussian, I'm certain you agree." Tresckow's face said anything but. "Now go. You are dismissed.""

 speerflavor.73.desc:0 "He had felt tremors before, but not this bad. He hadn't the strength to open the constant flood of documents sent to his office, so his desk was filled with unread papers. He didn't have to read them, of course, he knew exactly what direction this revolt would go. They would push and push, and the Wehrmacht would push back, until finally, the Aryan heel would stomp down and annihilate the petty resistance the revolt gave to submitting to the New Order. The thought soothed his mind a little, but he was still bitter with anger, and a certain someone kept trying to push him down another road.\n\n"My Führer-" Schmidt began, and Speer took no chances, slamming a fist against the desk and glaring at him with rageful, tired eyes.\n\n"This nonsense AGAIN?!" He said, stirring himself into anger. "Helmut Schmidt, know your place. I've spent the past two decades trying to move past web after web, and now you're constantly biting at my ankles, here and there. Who do you think I am, Schmidt? Some sort of peace-loving liberal scum? Perhaps you are, but I am far from such a thing."\n\nSchmidt ground his teeth together, feeling his breathing become heavier. "I've advised you, time and time again, that clashing with the slaves would ruin our international image!"\n\n"To hell with our international image! You..." Speer's eyes narrowed towards Schmidt. "You... lying in bed with the Reichsbanner, aren't you?" Schmidt felt his stomach churn, and he stepped away. "I should have seen this earlier. I should've realized a decade ago. You are more than just some pathetic liberal. I know who you are now, Schmidt - you are a rat! A RAT!" Speer kicked back his chair and stood up, almost frothing at the mouth. "Get out of my office! Get out, you Judeo-Bolshevik bastard! Get out before I have you hanged as an enemy of the state!" Schmidt felt sweat drip down his back as he began walking out, while Speer didn't relent."

 speerflavor.74.desc:0 "One bullet in the chamber and none in the magazine. That's all that he needed. All that he wanted. Speer calmly slid the gun under the desk and swallowed back pent-up saliva. Then the tremors returned, and Speer raised his head to look up at the maps on his desk. Here was Germany, powerful and strong, a population of more than a hundred million, built on success after success, and with his guiding hand would steer it into the future. In the east, it was all stripes and circles. The slaves. The whelps. The untermenschen. They had taken so much territory now, and again and again his Aryan people failed him. He would not allow it. No, no, no, no, no. The Führer was no longer Adolf Hitler - it was Albert Speer. He held the power now. He called the shots. All he had to do was make the call. Make the call... make the call...\n\nMake the call.\n\nPapers and office equipment clattered to the floor, and Speer slammed open a drawer, pulling a pen out. The map of Europe remained, and he began scribbling it. Just like when he was back with Hitler, when strategies would be described. He punctured holes into the map to signify where the tanks would blitz. He scribbled across whole areas that would be carpet bombed. Oh, they would learn their place. By gun, bullet, fire, tank. He didn't care what the rest of the world thought. Germany was the master of the world, and everyone else would bend the knee. "And him..." He muttered, voice grazing against his throat with hoarse pain. His eyes flicked to Germany.\n\nSpeer let out a short, raw chuckle. "Helmut Schmidt. You, you Jew. You Zionist little puppet. How I'll see you hang.. m-maybe I'll..." He reached in a hand and barely wrapped his fingers around the grip as he pulled the pistol out, and it clattered weakly on the table. "Yes... yes, that's what I'll do. I don't need to sign papers. I'll just do it myself!" He laughed harder this time, and he furiously drew on the map, a line here, a circle there. "There will be a million dead Untermenschen before they take an inch of Germany!""

Ever since Speer fantasized about returning to his roots as the dictator of Germany, he was scared. What if it went wrong? What if he was stopped? So he anxiously waited for something - and that something came.\n\nWhen Albert Speer received the news that Willy Brandt was now in support of the slave revolt, his mind went into a white haze of rage. Without thinking, he tore the classified document in half, and reached for his gun. He knew where Helmut Schmidt was, and within minutes he knew the Jew would be dead. If only Speer had the patience to give him something worse.\n\nStorming out of his office, he began walking directly to Schmidt's office with only one thing on his mind, but something stopped him. In the dim shadows of the Reichskanzlei he could hear footsteps behind him. Before he could turn around, pain shot through his arms as hands grabbed on tightly, and in front of him walked Reinhard Gehlen. "What the hell are you doing, Gehlen?!" He screamed. "No... you know, you know! What do you know?!"\n\nGehlen gave a small smile as he recovered a thick document and a lighter in each hand. "My Führer." There was no weight to that word. "I have an...interest in keeping things as is. Here," he said, wiggling the document mockingly in his hand, "is a list of all the terrible things you did during your tenure as Minister of Armaments and War Production. Here," he continued, flicking the lighter open near the paper, "is your freedom. Choose wisely, Herr Speer. One will end you. The other will free you."\n\nSpeer could barely see anything past unfocused shapes, but he could hear crisply what the man said. His strength failed him as he attempted to break free. "He set you up, didn't you?" He asked, and Gehlen raised an eyebrow. "Schmidt - he did it, he brought you here, he knew what'd happen, didn't he? Didn't he?!" Fury filled his cracking voice, and all he could think about was how Schmidt would look with a bullet in his brain. "Schmidt!" His lungs pained him. "Schmidt!" Gehlen merely shook his head with disappointment. "SCHMIDT! YOU DEGENERATE SCUMBAG! COME OUT, COME OUT SO I CAN KILL YOU! SCHMIDT!""

Sometimes that woman who talked to him in the factory visited here and there, and they talked. They would talk about current things happening, and she was like a source of information. He learned things outside of his simple life - how the world was in turmoil, how Germany was making this sweeping change and passing this outstanding law.\n\nHow they were still treacherous bastards, and how things would never remain the same, and how day-by-day, things only grew tenser.\n\nAntonin knew it would happen. In fact, he was waiting for it. When he received a pair of knocks on his door, he closed the book in his hands that was about the great Slavic migration into eastern Europe, and unbolted the chain, letting it open slightly so that he could look outside. "Yes?" His old, unused voice asked, and he could see it.\n\nTwo men in uniforms-- and the sign of the Polish Home Army. "Greetings, Antonin Grzywacz. We're here on behalf of the Free Europe army." In his hands he held a rifle that harkened back to old times.\n\n"Will you fight, sir?" The man's face was hard, but sympathetic. "There will be no work for you tomorrow."\n\nAntonin knew that well.\n\n"But I can understand it if you wish to remain here."\n\nSlowly, Antonin unbolted the door completely, and let it open wide. He was old, perhaps even frail, but... Antonin shook his head.\n\n"No, son," he began, holding his hands out. The soldier nodded, and handed him the rifle. "I can still fight. Er..." He looked down, then back up. "Before we go, can I ask you a question?"\n\nThe soldier took no time to respond, even sounding a little enthusiastic. "Of course.""

 speerflavor.77.desc:0 "Where had he gone in these last fifty-something years in his life? What did Antonin make of it? He was a young boy in Poland... oh, how lovely the fields were all up until the point where they weren't. He grew from a boy into a teenager and from a teenager into a man, and he had settled down with a beautiful girl he knew from across his home - and they had raised three children, one who was just a bit slow but it didn't matter to him nor to her and it never bothered the child's siblings. They had all been beautiful.\n\nHad been beautiful. Then, for the past twenty years, Antonin was a hollow man. The Nazis had taken everything from him, grinding his family into dust and ashes and only spitting him out, untainted yet broken. How he longed for death and for the relentless pain in his mind that followed him day after day. Then things had begun changing. Finally, perhaps, the German was showing mercy. Something else that wasn't sheer cruelty, monstrosity, bloodshed. He had met a man who sparked the flame known as friendship with him, and he was a German. What was his name... he couldn't remember.\n\nThen, one day, they had finally given him his freedom. And at home he met another woman. Her name was Anna, and she was fierce, perhaps a bit younger than him but he had been working up the courage to ask her to go on a date with him. Now he laughed about it, and then drew in a sharp breath. The bullet lodged in his stomach made his body numb and his sight fuzzy, and God how he had hoped that some Nazi would have walked in and put him out of his misery or that some tank rolled over him, or an artillery shell blowing his body into pieces.\n\nNo such thing. No such thing - and no help would ever come. He was abandoned by the frontline, and it had long since moved past him. Long into the night, when his consciousness began fading, Antonin cried. For as much as he wished for death, he was truly afraid of it. He didn't want to let go, even if the pain was overbearing, but reality caught up to him. By the time the sun rose, Antonin was dead."

Many thoughts coursed through his head, but as he glanced between him and Anna, he swallowed back the anxiety.\n\nThe messenger, meanwhile, glowed with positivity. "Good news! Everyone, listen closely. Th-the Reichsbanner managed to haggle with the Germans - we get to go home!"\n\n"What?!" Shouted Antonin, and the messenger seemed ecstatic.\n\n"We get to go HOME!"\n\nInstantly, cheers from Antonin's squad erupted, and infected the partisans that were in the nearby buildings. His confused expression quickly shifted into a joyous grin, and he went to hug Anna, who gladly accepted it.\n\n"We get to go home, Anna," he muttered. "W-we can finally rest. Oh my God, I've been waiting so long for this..."\n\n"And I've still yet to see you fire your gun," Anna replied, giving a short, happy chuckle, and they hugged each-other tighter before letting go.\n\n"I asked if you'd join the resistance back then, and here you are now, a freedom fighter who's gained his freedom without firing a single shot." Her expression sombered, though her smile remained. "Antonin..." She trailed off, as she could notice that he had an anxious look on his face. "What's wrong?"\n\nAntonin rubbed the back of his neck and smiled awkwardly. "S-see, Anna, I... I'm... a widower, to put it bluntly, and I..." Anna's eyes widened.\n\n"I have no ring, but I'm sure I can buy one eventually. Will you-"\n\nAnna leaped in and wrapped her arms around Antonin, and he could feel his eyes swell with tears.

 speerflavor.79.t:0 "Die Deutsche-Physik"
 speerflavor.79.desc:0 "As any good German should know, Mein Kampf teaches that the tendrils of Judaism are deeply rooted in the entire world: fearing open confrontation with the master Aryan race, the despicable lot tries to gain the upper hand through cunning and guile. Jewish personalities are embedded in all sectors of society: from banks to industry to science, the amount of people openly or covertly swearing their allegiance to the six-pointed star of David and Judas is staggering.\n\nAs such, it's only natural that the relatively new field of Physics would immediately be infected by such a plague. From Albert Einstein to Enrico Fermi, the false doctrine of Jüdische Physik has tried to subvert science from the inside, spreading false beliefs on how the very fabric of the world was structured. It was only a matter of time before the true Aryans would try to cleanse universities and scientific institutes from this filth, and replace it with the true science, the Aryan science!\n\nFrom this cauldron of national pride and racial superiority was Deutsche-Physik born, a titanic effort aimed at replacing the decadent and corrupt Jüdische Physik with a doctrine that truly answered the great questions of our time. However, National Socialism wasn't alone in his quest for truth, and many had already tried, even on their own, to refute such false beliefs on the ground of Aryan rationality. From Hanns Hörbiger's Glazial-Kosmogonie in 1912, many other enlightened intellectuals, such as Nobel laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark understood the need to compile and organize a pure scientific community along the party-approved line of Gleichschaltung, a hierarchical coordination based on adherence to the official doctrine of national socialism."

While the overwhelming majority of all academic institutions believed such theory with the same fervour a policeman believes the excuses of someone caught pickpocketing, they were forced to keep their criticism for themselves as the Deutsche-Physik had been officially embraced by the NSDAP, and counted personalities such as Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler themselves among its staunchest supporters: to denounce its falsehood meant being branded as a "Juden-freunde" and subsequently purged. As such, an uneasy peace had been struck between the universities and the party leadership: the former would abstain from openly refuting the theory, while the latter would abstain from sending the most esteemed professors to the concentration camps as enemies of the state, especially since their minds were needed for the war effort more than their arms would be in any slave factory.\n\nAfter Himmler's exile and Hitler's death, and with the new Führer set on a more moderate approach to science and politics, the scientific community is once more in upheaval, and many feel that the day of reckoning has finally come. A scientific council has been convened in Germania, where the most prominent academics from the entire Reich will be present to discuss the future of science in this new era for Germany and the world. Even more importantly, the opening event will be a strong, official rebuttal of the entire doctrine of Deutsche-Physik, to be branded as a 'delirium inspired by racial hate and intellectual deficiency'. In its place, the council will ask for the scientific community to be regulated by merit and experience, rather than boot-licking and party allegiance."

 speerflavor.81.desc:0 "As predicted, the news of the Grand Scientific Council of Germania has created an uproar in the NSDAP, with the reformist welcoming an opportunity to finally let go of another part of Hitler's embarrassing legacy, and the conservatives accusing the scientific council of going against party doctrine, which in their opinion is akin to high treason. Already letters are piling on the Führer's desk, asking him to officially support one side or the other, and the amount is getting close to the alarm threshold: should Speer refuse to take action, it will be interpreted as a sign of weakness, and he can't afford such a thing!\n\nForced to take action, the Führer stops to reflect. Preventing the council from happening is absolutely out of the question, as it will enrage the universities that were his first and largest support base during the Bürgerkrieg, and now are the fundamental pillar upon which to build a new Reich, filling the technological gap separating the country from the other world powers.\n\nAs it stands, there are only two possible choices: the first is to cave in to the conservatives without angering the scientists, which would mean completely ignoring the council and act as if it never happened, a safe choice in difficult times; the second is to openly support the reformists, and attending the council in person, thus sending a clear message to everyone about the new course the Reich is being set on. What will his decision be?"

Hundreds of scientists, academics, researchers and inventors coming from around the Reich gaze in amazement at the coronation of the Führer's skill as an architect, as they wait for the Grand Scientific Council of Germania to begin. At the very center of the Volkshalle, a hemicycle of chairs houses the Reichstag in full extraordinary session, with an adorned armchair topped by a golden eagle at its front for the Führer himself; the scientists will be accomodated in rows upon rows of chairs, with a long, frontal desk for the deans and other directors.\n\nEveryone is in their place, in a perfect choreography directed by the expert eye of Leni Riefenstahl behind the lens of her trusted Olympia-Kanone. At the given signal, everyone stands as the Führer arrives from the Halle's main entrance, the crowd parting for him like the Red Sea before Moses, until he takes his place: with the brightest mind of the Reich before him, and the Reichstag behind him, he addresses the entirety of the German people.\n\n"Citizens of Germania, today marks a new dawn! After long years of exile inflicted upon them by fools and charlatans, we welcome science, rationality and enlightenment back into our fold, never to let it go a second time!"\nA round of applause, then he resumes: "I wanted to be present to this historical day, to let our esteemed researchers and academics know that their plight has been noted by our government: their bright minds, unparalleled skill and selfless dedication to the cause of science shall pave the way for our country to resume its place among the great nations of Earth!"\n"Let science be one with national socialism as it was meant to be, free from the shackles imposed by envious men who believed they could decide whether innovation was pure or not!

However, the council got almost no media coverage, and its results were publicated only by scientific journals and publications, with the result that, for all intents and purposes, the larger public never knew of its existence, which was exactly what the Führer wanted.\n\nIn the end, he managed to keep the party united by adopting the line of 'less resistance' and, while some reformists were disappointed by his move, and some conservatives were still angry over the fact that the gathering was allowed to happen, no one could truly complain much: the scientists had secured their grand congress, and the conservatives had ensured it would amount to nothing in the political sphere, a perfect result for everyone!"

A few reichsmarks would have served him well, but to the surprise of noone, he only made enough to buy himself the barest amount of food possible. As his thin and worried frame entered through the door of the office, he could hear the rolling of the train engine and a whistle as it came to a stop - there to pick up more of his kin, but not him - he had something to resolve.\n\n"Mister Vogel?" Marceli asked, seeing the older German sitting on his chair and writing something off perk an eyebrow.\n\n"Herr- ugh," his Polish was rusty as he looked up, "what is problem?"\n\nMarceli took a deep breath. "Mister Vogel, yesterday it came to light about my planned destination to where I would permanently relocate to. Krakow?" He asked, already feeling some of his anger boiling, but he kept it in. "Surely this is a mistake - I was born in Gdańsk!"\n\nFor a second's pause did the German man look at him before sighing and shaking his head. "Danzig-" Marceli's frown became laced with irritation. "-Is Greater Germanic Reich territory. You are relocated to biggest Polish city because it is a similar urban environment."\n\nMarceli's heart leaped to his throat. "Th-that's ridiculous! Gdańsk is my home, more than any other city, even if it isn't within the borders of Poland itself!" He began, already clutching his hands into fists subconsciously. "Where can I ask for a transfer?!"\n\n"... You?" Vogel looked at him like he was a fool. "Ask? Blinder Dummkopf... wie sagt man das nochmal... ah!" His gaze suddenly sharpened, and Marceli felt stricken with fear. These were the eyes of a man who had gone through this before, hadn't he.\n\n"Please, Mister Vogel-"\n\n"Word of advice."

 speerflavor.91.t: "The Doctor in the Reichstag"
 speerflavor.91.desc: "Theodor Oberländer looked out before his kingdom, the floor of the Reichstag, and allowed a deep scowl to spread across his face. The assembly was not in session that day, but these chambers were a place where he could think. And, at the moment, Oberländer needed to think, to choose a course. He stood from his seat, where he had heard so many proposals and pressed so many stamps into ink. Allowing his mind to go elsewhere, the man began to pace across the Reichstag floor.\n\nAs one of Hitler's ministers, it had been clear Speer would set the Reich on the right course. Oberländer had seen that for himself, as one of the first members of the Reformist faction. Only fools and yes-men had truly believed there would be no change needed after the West Russian War. As Führer, however... Oberländer could only shudder to think what idiocy Speer would attempt to carve National Socialism into. There was a reason his supporters were called Speerites, and not reformers. Any true reformer would see what inoperable madness Speer's real plans contained.\n\nBut even a Führer did not rule alone. Oberländer had been the sole voice of reason then, and he would continue to be so now. The German people, he believed, would listen to intelligence and reason over the rhetoric of firebrands. The party could easily be led to see that such changes had to be done with a light hand. Speer could be kept in check, if Oberländer held him to account. That would be the doctor's solemn duty. He swore it to himself, his final act of vigil in the empty Reichstag.\n\nSuch was his focus on that promise that he did not notice an aide approach him until the boy spoke. "Herr Oberländer? The Führer would like to speak with you." Oberländer disliked the casual tone with which this child spoke to him. Speer did not grasp the difference between a true reformer, and a rebellious youth mindlessly rejecting that which his parents had taught him. A sneer found his face as he replied."
 speerflavor.91.a: ""If the Führer wishes.""

 speerflavor.92.t: "The Moderate"
 speerflavor.92.desc: "Theodor Oberländer gritted his teeth, approaching the podium after Speer's man, Erhard, had given his due. It had been short, to the point, and wildly disrespectful. Just like the man himself. Nevertheless, had been as radical as one would expect. It was baffling that Speer had chosen such a toad to lead his economic policy, but he had again never been practical. Oberländer allowed the scant applause to dissipate before addressing the assembly.\n\n"Thank you, Herr Erhard." He spoke curtly and nodded to the economist, who did not look very happy to be thanked. "I think we all need to recognize the value in what is being said.I am far from claiming the economy is perfect. However, I am quite worried about the scale on which Herr Erhard describes these changes. This... revolution of the German economy that he suggests is, I must say, rather radical." He noted . "Radical, and very, very, foolhardy."\n\n"Herr Erhard, of course, has made great use of his PhD in economics. He is the Reichsminister of Finance, after all." Oberländer conceded. "But a PhD is something that helps primarily in classrooms and hypotheticals. This sort of plan that he suggests would work wonders in a bubble where there is only economics to consider. My own doctorate in finance, however, shows that I am well-experienced in the realities of putting such things into practice, unlike Herr Erhard. And my doctorate in agriculture, meanwhile, shows that I can tell you how Herr Erhard would rob good German farmers of the chance to make a living."\n\n"There is not a man in this building who does not remember the collapse in the fifties. How it brought our enemies to our doorsteps and how it revealed the treachery of those we had once considered friends. Does Herr Erhard mean to bring the German economy to such a place of instability that it collapses again? When we consider the extent of Herr Erhard's plan today, we must think of one feature of any revolution, whether political or economic." Oberländer glanced around the room, noticing a furious Ludwig Erhard. "A revolution turns order on its head.""
 speerflavor.92.a: "The Reichstag began to applaud."

 speerflavor.93.t: "Madness and Purges"
 speerflavor.93.desc: "Theodor Oberländer walked into his office to find it had been ripped apart. His pillows had been tossed aside and torn apart, as if someone expected them to contain some secrets. His drawers had been left half open, and there were papers scattered all over the room. And yet, there was not a person around to answer for it. His first thought was that someone had broken into his office, stolen something of importance or value. But who would be bold enough to rob the President of the Reichstag? He did not have to think long about the answer.\n\nOberländer turned, sprinting down the hall from the ransacked office. For all he knew, they were already looking for him. The building was emptier and quieter than Oberländer had ever remembered it being. The only sound present were his shoes against the floor. He rounded the corner, seeing that the door to what was once Heydrich's office had been left ajar. His lungs heaving the mad dash, he entered the room and closed the door behind him, making sure to lock it.\n\nA folder had been left open on Heydrich's desk. Neatly stenciled on the front, he knew, were the words "Theodor Oberländer". Oberländer picked through the files until he reached the end. On the final page were the words he himself had added on the day of Hitler's death. "Completely cleared of all suspicions regarding disloyalty to the Reich." To anyone else's eyes, it would have looked as if it was a memo Heydrich had written years before. Any papers proving otherwise had been rendered to ash and were now sitting in Oberländer's home wastebasket.\n\nA sense of weightlessness and total relief filled Oberländer. They had found nothing. Speer had found nothing for which the President of the Reichstag could be blamed, no matter how exhaustive his search had been. As Oberländer stood to leave, he heard the unmistakable sound of gunfire from outside the window. He had not been the only one."
 speerflavor.93.a: "Speer will pay for this."

 speerflavor.94.t: "An Odd Alliance"
 speerflavor.94.desc: "It was Kiesinger that Oberländer sought out. He was the only one of the reformists that seemed reasonable at times, and the President of the Reichstag figured that if any of Speer's clique were going to listen to him, it was Silver Tongue. He spotted the former lawyer, as always, in the process of schmoozing some unsuspecting policymaker, no doubt trying to curry his favor for some ludicrous proposal of Speer's in the future. It gave Oberländer an odd spurt of pleasure to be interrupting such a thing.\n\n"Deputy Führer," The President of the Reichstag intoned when the conversation seemed to have hit a lull. "We need to speak for a moment, if you are not too busy." Kiesinger shot an apologetic look at his companions and excused himself. The two men walked for a moment until they were properly out of any man's earshot. Kiesinger gave Oberländer an expectant look, waiting for the President to speak. "Is what I have heard true? Does Speer intend to dismantle IG Farben and the other corporations?"\n\n"Yes, and for good reason." Kiesinger wasted no time launching into a spiel. "President Oberländer, you are an educated man, even holding a doctorate in economics. You know how these corporations have crippled the German economy. These companies have destroyed the German labor industry. Their stranglehold on the markets is not just a travesty, but a crime. A crime against the Reich and the ideals of National Socialism. It is the duty of the Führer to stop such things."\n\nOberländer nodded. "There's no need to convince me, Deputy Führer. I hold the leeches on the German state in as much contempt as you do." That revelation seemed to have taken Kiesinger by surprise. "Herr Kiesinger, I simply came to offer my assistance to the Führer in this brave endeavor. This is a matter of concern for all of Germany, and as President of the Reichstag I throw my full support behind it." The rest of the conversation was much more productive."
 speerflavor.94.a: "The two shook hands and parted ways."

 speerflavor.95.t: "The Change to Come"
 speerflavor.95.desc: "Theodor Oberländer sat in a chair, facing the most powerful man in Europe. Albert Speer sat at a desk, facing a legislator who irritated him to his core. Neither man particularly liked his company. "My Führer," Oberländer began, boldly yet deferentially. "Surely you are not truly considering repealing the Nuremberg laws? The party would riot, and so would the corporations. Such a drastic action, so quickly after the war, seems to me somewhat unwise."\n\nSpeer eyed the President of the Reichstag. What was he getting at? "Herr Oberländer, I am sure you know where my support base is drawn from. The Nuremberg system of racial discrimination has done nothing but weaken the Reich." For years, Oberländer had been just as harshly critical of the Nuremberg laws as the reformers. Had he fully succumbed to the party line, just to spite Speer?\n\n"My Führer, you misunderstand. I do not propose that we continue the policy, only the laws behind it." Oberländer withdrew a folder, which he slid across the table to Speer. "Enclosed, my Führer, you will find several reports from myself on the heritage of the Eastern European population. At the time of the Nuremberg laws, these were widely considered Slavic, inferior peoples. However, this research has shown that a higher proportion than previously known is in fact of Nordic stock, and as such, of proper Aryan genealogy."\n\nSpeer nodded, suddenly understanding the President's suggestion. "If this report were to come to light, the Nuremberg laws may need to be taken under a period of review. During this period, of course, the persecution of Untermenschen will need to be temporarily halted, to ensure no Aryans are unwittingly harmed." Speer eyed the President of the Reichstag. Perhaps Oberländer was more crafty than Speer had given him credit for."
 speerflavor.95.a: "He must be watched closely."

 speerflavor.96.t: "Brothers of the Shadows"
 speerflavor.96.desc: "Theodor Oberländer did not know Reinhard Gehlen well, on a personal level, but he knew of him. The man had been well-known to have spies under every corner during the Second World War, and Oberländer guessed, by his appointment to the head of the Reich's new intelligence agencies, he had not curbed his activities in that field. He would serve as Speer's dagger in the dark, where the Gestapo had previously served as the NSDAP's club in the night. Oberländer was not stupid enough to not know what it meant.\n\nNow, a small metal dot had found its way to the bottom of Oberländer's desk, as he had been informed earlier that morning. Speer had failed to remove Oberländer during the purges, and now, it seemed, he was on Gehlen's list of people to watch closely. This attempt to have Oberländer killed was more subtle than the last one, but this time, Speer had failed to catch him unawares. And, Oberländer expected, he would continue to fail in later attempts.\n\nOne side effect of working in the Reich's intelligence programs was that one tended to trust their team with their life. It was odd, given how much of the profession was built around lying and mistrust. But if you could not act swiftly and unflinchingly based on the information of other agents, you were not in the correct profession. That level of trust, tested again and again, tended to build some sort of bond, even if the Reich tried their hardest to ensure friendships did not form.\n\nThose bonds, it seemed, were strong enough for Oberländer's old compatriots from the Abwehr to enlighten him of the RND's new plans for him. With a grimace, Oberländer pried loose the listening device, letting it fall to the ground. As the heel of his well polished shoe grinded the bug to dust, the President of the Reichstag considered sending a bouquet of flowers in thanks."
 speerflavor.96.a: "Another attempt fails."

 speerflavor.97.t: "A Farewell"
 speerflavor.97.desc: ""Surely, there must be something that you can do to stop this, Oberländer." An indignant Schörner pressed the President of the Reichstag, who was becoming rather dissatisfied with the conversation. "You have the party's ear, the Reich's ear. If you call this injustice what it is, an injustice, then they will LISTEN to you!" He slammed his fist against the table, clearly in an expression of outrage. "They will be forced to listen to you, if they do not want the Reich's populace up in arms."\n\n"If you think that this is in any way my business, you are wrong, Herr Schörner." Oberländer carefully ran his hand over the part of the table that Schörner had hit, trying to be sure that he had not left a mark in it. The table had been a gift from his mother, and he did not want it ruined by a late-night visit from this ranting madman. "What sort of outrage would I invoke, informing the people that a military official had received a new assignment? And what would the outrage of the people, or the Reichstag accomplish, against the Führer's directives?"\n\nSchörner regarded the doctor with a look of undisguised disgust, flavored with the desperation of a starving man begging for scraps. "Oberländer, do you not see what Speer is doing? He is ridding himself of every competent and pure-minded member of the administration! He seeks to bastardize National Socialism, to bring about some Judeo-Liberal fantasy! You and I, we are the only ones who still command enough sway to stop him, before he ruins everything!" There was a look of hungry anger, something intensely frightening. "We cannot let him do this."\n\nAnd yet, Oberländer considered Schörner for a second. It seemed like madness, the bitter ramblings of a disgruntled general, and yet some of what he spoke rang true. Perhaps now was the time to make a stand, to make a move against Speer. Then, Oberländer noticed his wife peer into the room, wondering why Theodor had not yet returned to bed. Meeting her eyes, the President of the Reichstag rose. "Herr Schörner, I believe you have a train to catch." "
 speerflavor.97.a: ""The Reich will not collapse without you.""

 speerflavor.98.t: "Utter Failure"
 speerflavor.98.desc: "In this very room, so long ago, Oberländer had sworn to keep Speer in check.\n\nThat was the thought that kept running through his head, as men around him yelled and shouted at one another, each much more eager to shoot down the proposals of his enemy than make any contributions of his own. The president, usually one of the most boisterous voices in the Reichstag, watched quietly as the Reich's farce of a government bickered over what to do.\n\nSpeer had loosened the reins, and they had slipped from his hands. The slaves were revolting, just as dozens of party officials had expected. Speer, Kiesinger, Schmidt... They had given the Untermenschen the rope by which to hang the German nation. If they were to survive, if they were to continue... someone would have to do something.\n\nSomeone yelled for silence, and there was a clamor as the dissenting voices of the Reichstag eventually simmered down into silence. When all eyes turned to him and no one spoke, Oberländer realized that they were all expecting the President to address the assembly.\n\nFaced with the results of Speer's recklessness and searching for a solution, the Reichstag was looking to Oberländer."
 speerflavor.98.a: "All of Germany was looking to Oberländer."

 speerflavor.99.t: "The Party's Champion"
 speerflavor.99.desc: "Oberländer trusted few men, nowadays, and those men sat with him in this room. He had chosen them for their competence, their ideas, and their discretion, and he had no doubt they would see things the way he did. Nevertheless, they seemed to be taken aback when he first proposed what he feared needed to be done.\n\n"Of course the slaves have been mishandled. Otherwise they would not be currently in armed revolt." After a moment's hesitation, Paul Wegener continued, his brows furrowing. "President Oberländer, are you suggesting a putsch against the Führer?"\n\n"Of course I'm not suggesting a putsch, Herr Wegener." Oberländer snapped. "We already have one revolt in the Reich, and to spark a second would only further damage Germany. I am suggesting that, if Speer fails in resolving his own mess, we ensure his carelessness is not the death of the Reich."\n\nHeinrich Trettner nodded along as the President spoke. "If even one mother loses a son because Speer felt the need to curry the favor of Untermenschen, I worry for the future of his Reich." He glanced over at Wegener, who still looked uncertain of the prospect. "Would this have happened under Hitler, Paul? I don't think it would have."\n\n"From the bottom of my heart, Herr Wegener, I hope that this revolt will prove insignificant, and that the slaves will become docile at the first rattling of a saber." Oberländer's face was a blank sheet, betraying nothing but grim determination. "But I fear that it will not, and that is an eventuality for which we must prepare.""

 speerflavor.100.t: "An Offer to the Banker"
 speerflavor.100.desc: "It was said that to get things done in politics, one often had to reach across the aisle.Thankfully, the laws of the Reich had meant that Oberländer had never dealt with much opposition in the Reichstag. It had seemed a blessing at the time, but it meant that he did not have as much experience in manufacturing back-door dealings as he would have liked.\n\nNow, however, the Reich was facing the biggest crisis since the West Russian War. The madmen had declared war on the slaves. It was exactly what the President feared. Oberländer was not certain what anyone with half a brain believed a thousand dead Germans and ten thousand martyred Untermenschen would achieve. It would certainly not bring about a great Reich. And thus, that goal was left up to Oberländer, Wegener, and Trettner.\n\nHermann Josef Abs, a massive man whom Oberländer had grown to despise the very look of, eyed the trio. "President Oberländer. Wegener here tells me that we have something to speak about?" Oberländer could imagine the disdain was mutual, even if Abs did not show it. The last time they had spoken, IG Farben was being ripped to bits by Speer... with Oberländer's help. "I'm a very busy man, and time is money, after all."\n\nOberländer hesitated, glancing at his associates, and Trettner gave him a nod. There was no going back now, even if this step was the most difficult of all to justify in Oberländer's head. The doctor turned back to Abs, who had begun to light a cigar. What an ass. "Herr Abs," Oberländer ventured, "How would you like to be the most powerful banker in the world once more?"\n\nHe liked the sound of it."

 speerflavor.101.desc: "Ferdinand Schörner looked over the table which once belonged to Mikhail Gorbachov. The weak collaborationist government he had had to endure for so long was finally gone, and its stead, his own cabinet, made up of the most loyal German officers in Moskow.\n\nFrom left to right, the Russland Mutineers prepared their briefings on the state of the Militärbezirk. Immediately to his left, his close confidant Otto Ernst Remer. Next to him, the unfortunate consequence of having to compromise with the reactionary economic interests in the Reich which had made common cause in opposition to the liberals: IG Farben stooge Otto Ambros. A man far more to the liking of Schörner was Generalmajor Otto Wöhler, who had been forcefully retired by the traitorous liberals in Germania before Schörner rescued him. Last and in fact least amongst the cabinet ministers was Otto Abetz, in the now largely irrelevant role of representative to the Reich. Inspite of his irrelevance, Schörner still had a use for appearances, and so Abetz had to be kept around.\n\n"Very well Gentlemen." Schörner was interrupted by the sound of the cabinet room's door being opened, it was the chief of the intelligence for Heeresgruppe Russland, who had wisely joined him: Otto Wächter. Behind him, Otto Bradfisch, the liaison with Schörner's allies in Germany, closely followed. Reading all their names allowed while going through their reports, Schörner came to a stop. Something wasn't right, but he couldn't quite tell. After a brief pause, he continued to conduct the meeting, and only at its end realized what he was unsure about.\n\nOn his way back to Heeresgruppe Russland headquarters, he turned to his aide de camp, "
 speerflavor.101.a: ""Otto, haven't you noticed everyone here has the same name?""

 speerflavor.102.t: "King's Gambit"
 speerflavor.102.desc: "Theodor Oberländer breathed into his gloved hands and rubbed them together, gritting his teeth slightly before letting out a short sigh, a wisp of hot breath dissipating into the cold air. Far away, in the heart of Germania, he could see the snow-tipped Volkshalle, a behemoth towering over the city as an eternal reminder of National Socialism to its people. Disgust creeped up his throat.\n\nIn better circumstances, he would have found himself rallying the banner of the reformists. The shattered remnants of the NSDAP patched themselves together as the Speerite faction began winning over its contenders, and the will of the people was quashed under the liberal boot of Speer and his lackeys. Within a vacuum, their faction aligned with his goals. Without a vacuum, however, the truth was that he was alienated from them. He and Speer did not see eye-to-eye with each other, not at all, let alone his hand-picked and suspicious ministers, most especially that Ludwig Erhard and Helmut Schmidt. Their beliefs were intolerable.\n\nSo he found himself aligning with the remnants of the NSDAP before the war. The hardliners, the orthodox National Socialists, people obsessed with the picture painted by the triumphs of Germany before its series of catastrophes began. As Oberländer looked away from the Volkshalle and began moving towards his car, he scowled to himself, his footsteps filling the emptiness of the street, alongside his own thoughts. The hardliners were deluded if they thought that things could simply go back to normal like it was in the 30s and 40s, and while he found little interest in their beliefs, he did find much interest in their usefulness.\n\nIt was not an alliance born out of sympathetic causes, no, not at all. But there was no other option. The click of the car door and the roll of warmth coming from inside invited Oberländer in, and he slammed it shut behind him as he entered, key turning and engine revving as he gave one last glance towards Speer's show of ego.\n\nThe fools in his party and the madmen following Speer waited for his first move."
 speerflavor.102.a: "And the first move they would get."

 speerflavor.103.t: "Black, Burning, Kindling Flame"
 speerflavor.103.desc: "The heavy overcoat pressed down on his old, wiry frame, with only the occasional creak of the wood that his arms leaned against and the wind that blew past his ears alerting him to the fact that Speer was still conscious, still breathing. He had been so lulled into staring up towards the night sky, eyes piercing through the rolling clouds of fog, tracing one constellation and another, drawing his mind away from what was real, factual, and horrifying.\n\nAll it took was one bullet for him to be sent here. To Berchtesgaden. To this resort home that Hitler had built for him. A gift from decades ago from a man who felt, in this moment, barely responsive to Speer's memories. Schmidt had twisted this gift from him like a knife in a wound when he was told to come here and "de-stress". As if. That spineless coward hid behind a sorrowful frown and hid the fear he felt from Speer, all the while pretending what had happened had never happened. That-\n\nHe felt his fist impact the wooden railing, irritation trailing across the side of his palm and finger, and he didn't even bother to look up as he continued to stare longingly towards the stars and the mountains, the thick blankets of a white smokey haze providing a strange sense of comfort. It reminded Speer of the ambitions he had before coming into politics - a simple job, a simple pursuit, and a simple end, but the world could never be so predictable and so easy. Destiny, if it even existed, had other plans for him.\n\nHis shoulders ached and his body was irritable, but Speer stayed put regardless. He could have stared into the great world beyond him for hours and hours, marvelling in its excellence, even if it was a tiny fragment of what encompassed the planet. But he couldn't deny that a tight feeling in his chest formed the more time that had passed, and at some point he could feel it breathe in and out irregularly. As beautiful as the world was in front of him, untarnished by war, untouched by petty politics, he knew he had taken a plunge into darkness."

 speerflavor.104.t: "Letter of Penance"
 speerflavor.104.desc: ""I should have you shot, dog!"\n\nThe uncommon spark of fury within Speer's voice only prompted a smile from Schörner, who felt pain shoot through his back as he was slammed against the wall by two Orpo agents, cold concrete running across the length of his thin coat. Speer, meanwhile, stood two meters away, carrying with him a loaded pistol, as well as a menacing glare in his gaze. "You are one of the worst traitors to the Reich, and by all accounts, I should have you executed here and now!" He continued, pulling back the hammer of the gun as Schörner could see the round, smooth black of the barrel pointing down at him.\n\nThe silence that came from Schörner emphasized the small cough he gave afterwards, ringing insultingly throughout the bland and empty room, and he felt the sun flood his neck with warmth as he craned his head up to look at Speer. "Well, then, go on." He said, lips parting to reveal a small, victorious grin. "Kill me. Start another civil war. I am certain the militarists will accept whatever judgement you pass." The burning sarcasm tightened Speer's grip on the pistol, and a finger itched to slip into the trigger zone - yet didn't. "Perhaps you can even quarter and draw me. Then they would cheer, wouldn't they?" A defiant gaze followed a sudden sharper and louder tone. "Wouldn't they, Herr Speer?"\n\nSpeer grimaced so hard he felt like his teeth would shatter. In a moment of anger, a tired hand swung cold steel towards Schörner's head, slamming him and leaving a heavy bruise on the grinning man's face. "Release him!" Speer ordered, and Schörner felt his limbs lighten. "And get the Hell out of my sight. I don't want to look at you until things stabilize."\n\nBlood pooled from the cut inside his cheek, and Schörner spat, staining Speer's shirt with red."

"국가 안보를 위해" 독일국 밖에서 오는 선박에 대해 모든 항구는 폐쇄야 할 것이다. 그 어떤 선전물에 쓰이는 것 보다 더한 더러운 말들로 보아 당은 자급자족 경제를 거절하는 것에 동의하지 않는 것 같았다.\n\n슈페어는 자신의 책상을 바라보았다. 책상 위의 커피 한 잔은 이제 훨씬 비싸질 것이다. 그나마도 합법적인 시장에서 발견 할 수 있다면 말이다. 그의 책상은 일본 고관으로 선물받은, 인도네시아 정글에서 재배된 흑단으로 조각한 책상이었다. 이제 화려한 열대 목재 가구는 없을 것이다. 그는 그가 앉아 있는 방, 그의 가장 위대한 작품인 폴크스할레에 있는 그의 사무실을 둘러보았다. 모든 석재와 조명기구, 모든 전선과 바닥의 파이프는 그의 독일국에서 채굴되고 생산되었다.\n\n그는 그 토대에 얼마나 많은 노예가 묻혔는지 알지 못했다."

But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. My punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.\n\nI am inside my head again. I turn to the minister reading his notes, not that I can remember his name. He was saying something about death warrants. I'll probably have to sign them later. No doubt it would be someone I knew of, someone with too many good ideas making too much noise. I'd attended meetings like this in Hitler's day, and I didn't care for them then. I don't care now, though not for the same reason. Back then I was too busy daydreaming of plans of buildings unbuilt.\n\nI know I am daydreaming now, but again for a different reason. People believed in me, but who am I? An architect? A warlord? A dictator? All these and more. I have made excuses every day, pretended to myself he did not see, I did not know, but I knew what was going on and did not care. Rise higher, throw more people beneath your boots, then perhaps you can make a change. Then my ego had taken over - why am I surrounded by killers, by liars, by men of such arrogance? Surely I can do better in these trying times than these lunatics? Now I am Hitler, and I seem to be the only one who knows.\n\nI recall the first time he had witnessed a speech from that paradoxical man. I had expected swastikas, brown shirts, roaring and demagoguery. He had been met by the opposite - a man in an inexpensive suit sharing his worries about his country he loved. He had mentioned the Jews of course, but only in passing, a menace of bankers rather than blood. Goebbels had been different, a frothing mess, a roaring croud, a repulsive spectacle. Yet still I joined. I was not choosing the NSDAP but becoming a follower of Hitler, I told myself. He had taken hold of me before I grasped what was happening, I believed for many years.

Still the reactor thrummed away, atoms crashing and splitting with one end product - Plutonium. They had accumulated Uranium aplenty from their conquests in Russia and Africa, but that volatile and vital component in nuclear weapons was needed now more than ever - or so he was told.\n\nFissile material production had ramped up in response to the Reich's recent demand that their weapons stockpile be doubled in size, to appropriately operate as a deterrent. Speer did not see the difference - one city killing bomb will kill as many as a hundred if there are no more cities to be found. To his new ministers it seemed an economic stimulus, allowing for great expansion within those old, proud companies that dominated heavy industry and big science. To Schörner it was another opportunity to swing his weight and make room for himself. To him, it was a waste. There would be no economic recovery if there were no people to recover it.

On the higher slopes he noted mortar positions, subtle dots of sniper nests, flak cannons ready to repel any plane that dared to stray too close to the gun-toting obelisk they inhabited. Unfortunately for Albert it had been a bumpy ride in a truck with some stern-faced Fallschirmjagers followed by a hike that had left his knees weak - no helicopter could reach this rarefied level of air.\n\nHe waved his hand at his binocular-toting secretary, and raised the pair to his eyes. The Italians too occupied a spot in the clouds, scant kilometres away across tank traps, minefields, Czech hedgehogs and enough barbed wire to enclose Ost-Paris. He'd seen the reports, things were escalating here. More equipment, more men, bigger plans, the OKW had demanded it all and got it. He just prayed there would be no spark to light the fuse."

speer_natsoc.15.t:0 "Another Runner in the Night"
speer_natsoc.15.d:0 "He should have seen it coming, in hindsight. The gang of reformists that he had gathered around himself, so often attempting to assert their own will in place of his own ceasing their bleating for one blessed moment? He had welcomed it. He wasn't quite sure what the final straw had been, there seemed to have been so much debate between them all in the smoky halls of the Volkshalle. All he knew was that when their respective secretaries made their morning calls, Herren Kiesinger, Erhard, Schmidt, and their families were not there. They had searched, naturally, and found themselves at the end of a trail that had could have been years in the planning, one last ratline in the event they didn't get their way.\n\nHe had raged, at first. It was a rare time he let his temper get the better of him, but that night was the first in a month of furious tantrums; against that Gang of Three with their conspiracies; against the Reich he had worked so hard to fix crumbling before his eyes; at himself. Most of all, however, he was afraid. He could feel the sharks circling. There were other, less enlightened members of the party that believed themselves more suitable for the task than he - and he was too dangerous to be left alive.\n\nHe was wrong. Oberländer had neutered him, shoved his hand up his arse and was now controlling him like a ventriloquist's dummy. No more allies meant no more Speer. Of that band of like-minded reformists, only von Tresckow remained, too loyal to his Prussian ideals to ever contemplate mutiny. Albert envied him that simplicity. Now his erstwhile allies were likely sunning themselves in America - all too eager to leave their Reich behind."
speer_natsoc.15.a:0 "We remain."

speer_natsoc.16.t:0 "Damnatio Memoriae"
speer_natsoc.16.d:0 "It is all too easy to forget a person ever existed. We are only so much as the mark that we leave on this world, Albert reflected from his living room. Margarete was out somewhere, not that they paid one another much attention these days. It was all too easy to simply spend the evening gazing into the fire, flick a piece of paper in and watch it wither and curl. He had almost forgotten his book.\n\nIt didn't do to have traitors in the former ranks of such esteemed men as his current cabinet, so they had been removed. Every piece of paper they had signed was redacted. Every law they signed could be repealed, for it was a sabotage. Even their homes had been demolished, and mention of their names had been forbidden from any form of media. It didn't bear saying what had happened to their housekeeping staff.\n\nIn America no doubt they would be telling tales of the daring snub to the Reich, but here no news of their escape would ever run. People might ask what had happened to the ministers, but they would never get an answer - and eventually they would reach their own conclusions. He returned to his book.\n\n"
speer_natsoc.16.a:0 "Who the hell was Herostratus?"

speer_natsoc.17.t:0 "The Speer Defense"
speer_natsoc.17.d:0 "It's easy to blame something on someone who isn't there. Like a fart in an elevator, blame belongs to whoever left last. Therefore the logical thing to do was to blame every problem on their recent departures.\n\nThere was an economic downtown? It wasn't me.\nTurn your information over? It wasn't me.\nOur government is losing power? It wasn't me.\nInstall security cameras? It wasn't me.\n\nIndeed, to the party it had seemed like there was all too little Albert had done. It was only natural someone else take the reins, if only as a guiding hand. It seems denying culpability only gets you so far. The propaganda continued however - the Gang of Four had been spies, infiltrators of the highest order. Perhaps in a way it was true. It had certainly been a blunder of the highest order."
speer_natsoc.17.a:0 "책임을 떠넘기는 것이 받아들이는 것 보다 더 쉽지."

speer_natsoc.18.t:0 "I'm Just a Soul Whose Intentions are Good"
speer_natsoc.18.d:0 "Collective responsibility had been something he had taken very seriously while he still had some weight to throw around - while the Führer made the decision, everyone agreed it was the best decision. As such, all the awful, treasonous ideas of that clique of traitors would be collectively agreed to be eliminated - only this time, the shoe was on the other foot. It was his own ministers so eagerly dictating the removal of their predecessors' ideas. While Albert agreed with a few of these in principal, he most certainly disagreed with the gusto with which "his" ministers went about their business without consulting him.\n\nSpeer had always done his best to portray himself as the benevolent type of dictator, but that was becoming all the more difficult when his ministers' approach had shifted from velvet glove to iron gauntlet. The people had liked his new breed of more civil ministers, especially the students who had put him in this building in the first place. But god, if he didn't miss their bickering. He was certainly reminded of it enough by the pile of documents he had to plough through to eliminate their subversive influence.\n\nAnother law revoked - stamp. Another plan cancelled - stamp. Another protection removed - stamp."
speer_natsoc.18.a:0 "Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood."

speer_natsoc.19.t:0 "Coffee with Kiesinger"
speer_natsoc.19.d:0 "Naturally his subversive former friends were being monitored closely. Once the Reich's sharpest men had been made aware the trail existed they reached the other end with a mere hop of the Atlantic. Albert had contemplated having them eliminated, but decided against it. The open murder of former government officials claiming asylum was too brazen by half. They were instead watched from a distance, and Albert received reports on their activities every single day.\n\nHe recalled the mornings he had spent with Kiesinger, a cup of coffee and a sharp debate. Kurt had always been the easiest of them to deal with, the most realistic. Those talks had been spirited, but had never exasperated him nearly as much as that windbag Erhard. He had always seemed to have the right words to get what he wanted, and Speer would observe him running circles about him just as often as the other two.\n\nAlbert sipped his coffee and flicked through the report. Kiesinger had been talking to the Americans of course, who knew how long for. Every day he met with CIA agents, who were presumably digging for every scrap of information about Speer and his new government. Kurt would have them hanging on his every word for as long as he desired."
speer_natsoc.19.a:0 "It always was his talent."

speer_natsoc.20.t:0 "Smoking with Schmidt"
speer_natsoc.20.d:0 "Schmidt was confusing. He had been deferential, polite, capable. At first, his only flaw had been the smoking. They'd actually had to increase the cleaning budget to deal with the buildup on the ceilings. But as time went on, something beneath was revealed. Schmidt did not like many of the people he worked with. He did not like many of the policies his government had. He seemed to dislike the Reich as an institution.\n\nNow of course, Speer knew that was exactly the case. Schmidt was a subversive, probably in league with Reichsbanner before he was forced to make his escape. While Erhard maintained himself by mooching off the economists of his host nation and Kiesinger was feeding the government information on a slow drip, Schmidt was openly denouncing his birth country, writing his tell-all memoirs. The informants in his household had managed to acquire a photograph of a page for his perusal. "Inside the Third Reich" was a uniquely unflattering picture of Speer and his management, and alluded to many things Albert would have rather kept under wraps."
speer_natsoc.20.a:0 "All shall be revealed."

speer_natsoc.21.t:0 "Economics with Erhard"
speer_natsoc.21.d:0 "Erhard had been the most annoying of them all. Filled a seat like Göring, talked like he was Bismarck and smoked like a damn chimney. Certainly, Speer's management of the economy had not been miraculous, but the way Erhard had talked like he wanted to tear it up by the roots made his blood boil. Now he was extolling the virtues of his own miraculous economic system, which would have saved the Reich from every damning flaw it had, real or imagined.\n\nThe Americans were eating it up by the sounds of it. His insights were being hailed as one of the best looks into the German system in decades, and he had apparently acquired his own coterie of "Continental Style" economists. Let them have the interminable naysayer. At least he could finally get a meeting done without having to open a window."

Rome defined itself by the mediterranean, their 'Mare Nostrum', while China, Portugal and Holland capitalised on spice flows to a greedy West. Humanity's first nations followed a similar origin point. Along the Indus, Yellow and Nile rivers, civilizations rose on the backs of boats carrying the boons of the agricultural revolution upstream and downstream. Preceding the building of any man's home is the greasing of palms, or a suitable means to begin doing so.\n\nModern nations follow the same principles. That's why, before the gun, a wise statesman has always picked the embargo; more discrete and far more vicious than it's lethal counterpart. Smith's prediction of a globalised economy has only assisted this balance further. One can defeat a breadless enemy before a single shot is fired.\n\nAll war must end, however, and today the economic war that the Reich and the United States have fought for decades is closing. The embargo has been lifted, and the lungs of the dormant commercial titan of the Hanseatic can breathe once more. Industrial works in the Ruhr bellow with a rejuvenated spirit, and the Germania Stock Exchange is entering what the American's call a 'bull market'. Both the Führer and the President have given optimistic speeches, celebratory words delivered from the Volkshalle and the White House, while their foreign ministries conclude business and return home in a better world.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise on an Atlantic at rest, with once bitter enemies shaking hands. In war, there are no winners, and in this peace history would seem to have produced two."

"You're saying there's a rebellion on?"\n\n"I'm not saying there's a rebellion, there IS a rebellion! They're all over the place!" The diplomat's voice crackled over the radio, the rattle of rifle fire occasionally making its way into the receiver. The fire was rapid, fast, and seemingly close. Helmut shifted as a mental picture began to form in his head.\n\n"So it's another slave rebellion. Well, shit, do what we did with the last one." He muttered into the phone, a hint of confusion mixing into his normal stately tone.\n\n"No, Helmut, you don't understand. This isn't some slave revolt. The whole fucking city is up in arms! They've got Reichsbanner flags, they're chanting-"\n\n"Reichsbanner?" A shot of excitement fired up Schmidt's spine, quickly followed by fear. This was simultaneously very good and very bad. "Shit, are you sure?"\n\n"We can't put this down! They've got guns, they've got ammo, I think they've stolen a few tanks- oh, shit!" The screeching of metal faintly pulsed through the receiver, quickly accompanied by the roaring of an angry crowd. "Fuck, ok, I've got to go. We're evacuating. Warschau is lost, repeat, Warschau is lost!" The line went dead with a slam.\n\nHelmut stood in disbelief, still glued to the phone. Finally, after a moment of silence, he dropped the receiver and rushed to the train station. This was going to be big."

Speidel, Schmidt, Kiesinger, Erhard, Tresckow- he could tell that each of them had rushed here on short notice. Their reactions were similarly varied- Speidel's calm exterior was betrayed by his deeply furrowed brow, Erhard and Tresckow both seemed worried, Kiesinger showed only mild interest, and Schmidt seemed to be almost excited at the thought. Speer regarded him with an extra stare before beginning. "So, give me a rundown."\n\n"Well, my Fuhrer-" Speidel began, but was quickly cut off by Schmidt's quick talking.\n\n"My Fuhrer, the Poles of Warschau have risen up, aided by the Reichsbanner. Apparently, this "Spartakus" has made his presence known there, and they're setting up for a potential counterattack. The Polish government is in disarray- they're trying to set up a new government, but they're not having a good time of it. The rebels have gone about freeing the slaves, lifting the Nuremberg laws, repealing restrictions-"\n\n"Why are you so excited about this, Helmut? They're fucking it all up! I've done so damn much for them and this is how they repay me? I don't know why I ever listened to any of you if all you do is give me problems!" Speer shouted, slamming his fist into the table. Schmidt recoiled, as did the rest of the gang- this was new.\n\nThe sudden silence was broken by the entrance of the secretary, delivering a new report to the Fuhrer. He read it, reread it, and then threw it in the air with a resounding "FUCK!""

That's all he's been doing for the entire time I've worked with him."\n\nKiesinger sighed. Perhaps he should have expected this- Speer's revolt to the slave siege some time ago hadn't exactly been a reasoned one. "In any case, my Fuhrer, we can't truly have an effective response until we know how far this is going to spread. It'll do us no good to try and put out these fires while more are picking up."\n\n"Why don't you look yourself, Kiesinger? Here we are, with our plans unravelling before us, with everything the conservatives said would happen coming true, and you're all standing around here preaching the merits of the Reichsbanner? Hell, Schmidt's been basically on their side since he got here!" Speer snapped.\n\n"I never said I was in support of the slaves." Schmidt responded. Speer turned to him with an incredulous look.\n\n"Bullshit. You think I'm dumb, Helmut? I can see it on your face. You've been waiting for this for years." Schmidt opened his mouth to respond, but Kiesinger waved him off.\n\n"In any case, my Fuhrer, we must wait until the cards fall. This is certain to get worse before it gets better." Kiesinger stated. As if to prove his point, the secretary returned, bearing more bad news. Speer groaned as he read it- before, at least it was confined to Poland. Now this was going to be a total mess."

Reports of isolated uprisings in factories, slave mobs arming themselves in the rebel holdouts, the occasional gunbattles with police and soldiers, and the slow consolidation of the rebels into an organized army. Every report that came in angered Speer even more, and only hardened his resolve against the other four men in this room.\n\nWhat a fool he was to trust them! Every step of the way, they had subverted his requests and gone against his orders. They had forced him, over and over, to agree with them and avoid collapse. Ever since he had brought them on, they had made his job harder than it ever had to be. And now, at the hour of Germany's greatest danger since World War II, here they were to subvert him again, poisoning his ideals and dragging Germany away from what made it such a power to start with.\n\nHe wouldn't take any more of it, he decided. From here on in, he would call the shots, not some petty idealists or fat capitalist or some old military man. As the report of the next city to fall- Minsk- came in, he made up his mind. Now was the time to really show who the true power in Germany was- him, Albert Speer."

speer_slaverevolt.5.t:0 "Nowhere Is Safe"
speer_slaverevolt.5.desc:0 "As reports continued to roll in of spontaneous rebellions, clear trends began to emerge from the haze. Speer reviewed them and pieced them together, a master architect building his latest work- not one of stone or steel, but one of statitistics. The cities that had revolted so far all fit the same few categories. Kiew, Warschau, Minsk, Krakow- all were poor, eastern cities. None had been successfully Germanized. Each still had significant amounts of slaves, whether personal or company owned. Finally, the major kicker- each had abnomally high levels of Reichsbanner activity. Perhaps it was the relatively young demographics of each city, or perhaps it was the universities, but the pattern was clear. A plan formed in Speer's head- this was still controllable. With the right analysis and the right plan, he could stop this rebellion in its tracks.\n\nAnd then a revolt seized Riga, and the statistics crumbled away.\n\nRiga shared none of these tells with the other cities, besides a high slave population. It held a significant German minority. It was rich, even after the chaos that had engulfed Ostland years ago. It had not even had a major Reichsbanner presence. Yet, here it was, another angry red mark of revolt splintering the Reich. Speer put the paper down on his desk to join the pile, sighed, and tore the rest of his analysis off the corkboard. Perhaps there was no pattern to this. Perhaps there was no stopping it."

speer_slaverevolt.6.desc:0 "There had been one saving grace to the Slave Revolt- its adherence to the cities. Each revolt was confined merely to the city- painful, but containable. The Heer, mobilized to action by the Fuhrer's personal order, sat in siege around the city, a complicated standoff ensuing between the slaves and the soldiers- neither side willing to fire first. As long as the revolt stayed inside the urban jungle, the Reich still stood.\n\nOf course, it didn't.\n\nSomehow, someway, the news spread to the slave plantations that still toiled in the countryside. One by one, the slaves found their spines, taking up arms against their masters and burning their fields to the ground. Mobs met each other and became armies, tearing through the countryside and burning any slaveowning home they found. Soon enough, the Wehrmacht found itself flanked, and, humiliatingly, was forced to retreat as the country slaves jubilously met with the students and rebels of the cities.\n\nAs the mood out east turned joyous, the mood in the Fuhrer's office darkened. Speer slammed his fist into his table, barely suppressing a angry yell. This was all that rat bastard gang's fault. They had played with fire, and now the whole Reich would burn."

speer_slaverevolt.7.desc:0 "Despite its relative calm compared to other Reichskommissariate, it seems Moskowien hasn't been spared from the chaos of the slave revolt. While indentured servants in the former Russian lands are far less than across the rest of the Reich, they still make up a considerable number, and it seems that the general chaos gripping the entire German colonial empire has emboldened them.\n\nAll across the Reichskommissariat, tens of thousands of slaves break their chains and assault the German garrisons overseeing their suffering, taking their weapons and establishing pockets of resistance in the Russian plains. They ask for freedom, and most of them are ready to fight to the death rather than kneel once more. If they are to die - this is the message relayed to the Reichskommissar - they will die as free men.\n\nEven though their numbers swell with every passing day, and local authorities struggle to protect the cities from the increasing wave of dissent, it seems that - unlike the metropolitan Reich - reaction is mounting. Reports tell of German regular forces regrouping under the leadership of Feldmarschall Schörner, and preparing for a counter-offensive: the general has sworn to return order to the Russian Reichskommissariat, "no matter the cost""

speer_slaverevolt.8.desc:0 "The eerie silence of the corridor was interrupted by the sharp clicking of boots against the polished floor. The men strode onwards with purpose, their overcoats fluttering behind them. They pushed through the door at the end of the corridor and marched up the crimson stairs, stepping around the crumpled bodies that punctuated every turn. When the gang reached the top, an armed officer saw them approach and thrust his hand into the air.\n\n"Heil Schörner!"\n\nFerdinand Schörner saluted in response. The traces of a smile were tugging at his lips, threatening to ruin his forcefully stern expression as he marched his men towards the cabinet room. At last, Moskau was his. Moskowien was his. The coup has been an absolute success, although naturally he had not been there to witness it.\n\nAnyone who dared resist the militarist infiltration of Moskau's government buildings – from the lowliest secretaries and guards to the highest politicians and generals – were shot on site. The rest were in the process of being deported to KZ like the traitors they were.\n\nThe men entered the cabinet room. Blood was splattered across the framed portraits that hung on the walls. Remer took a seat at the far end of the table and began speaking in a mockingly reedy voice, replicating Alexis von Roenne's mannerisms perfectly. The militarists cackled with laughter. A gunshot rang out somewhere on the floor below them.\n\nThe Reich cried out for a savior as the waves of treason threatened to drown it forever, and Schörner answered the call. A thin smile finally spread across his face. How long until his men were storming Germania and dragging the liberal rats out of the Reichstag by their ties?"
speer_slaverevolt.8.a:0 "Just how grand are this madman's ambitions?"

speer_slaverevolt.9.t:0 "Schörner In Control"
speer_slaverevolt.9.desc:0 "The report sat among what seemed like a million others on Speer's desk, the rest of the gang crowded in their various chairs. However, this one was clearly more important than any other- the Fuhrer had even cleared out a space on his desk for it, an island of paper on a sea of hardwood. He looked up at the gang and placed a finger squarely on the text. "You want to know what this says?"\n\nSilence. Ashamed, total silence. No gang member even dared to stare into Speer's flaming eyes.\n\n"'Feldmarschall Schörner has, after his coup in Moskowien, seized control of revolting areas through swift, forceful action. From the little information we are currently receiving, Reichsbanner rebels have either retreated into hiding or fled." Speer read, matter of factly. He looked up again when he finished. Still, none of the others dared to respond. "You know what this means? It means that Ferdinand fucking Schörner is the Reich's face of stability and action, and we're standing around with our pants down!"\n\n"Well, my Fuhrer, Schörner has the luxury to just run over protestors with tanks-" Schmidt started. Speer cut him off with a furious wave of his hand.\n\n"And why can't we do the same? They're the rebels. If the American students started shooting at their soldiers, they wouldn't pussyfoot around with their response, would they?"\n\nSilence- a stunned, disbelieving silence- entered the room. Slowly, the gang filed out, and Speer sat back down. That was certainly too far, but was it not a justified outburst? If Germania didn't do something and fast, Schörner would do it for them, and then they'd be in real trouble."

Aided by the Polish resistance, thousands of freed indentured laborers assaulted isolated barracks, police stations and other strategic locations all across central Poland, arming themselves with anything they could find: unprepared for an uprising of this magnitude, the German forces found themselves scattered and easy prey for partisans and enraged slaves.\n\nWith the central government unable to answer due to the mainland having the exact same problems, - only a hundred times worse - central Poland is effectively no-man's land. Bands of slaves roam the countryside and the cities, but without a unified leadership they act as they please: some merely try to return home, while others sack houses and stores, attacking all German settlers in sight."

speer_slaverevolt.11.desc:0 "As the slave revolt expands, Poland finds itself more and more in chaos. With central Poland devoid of any authority, Galicia was doomed to be the next, and as soon as the first news about unrest in the camps came to the garrison, its commanding officers were faced with a difficult choice: either evacuate as much personnel and equipment as possible, or try to crush the revolt in blood. Under the current circumstances, the first choice was preferred, though it is unknown whether the decision was motivated by humanity or lack of means.\n\nWith the German garrison gone, and the central government still reeling from the magnitude of what's happening, very few believe that the Reich will try to reclaim Galicia soon. Thousands of Russian and Ukrainian slaves roam the region, some of them moving East trying to find a way home, while others take advantage of the lack of security to exact their vengeance upon those unlucky enough to have been left behind."

As expected, the news of the ongoing revolt spread quickly among the indentured assets in the camps and factories, and soon unrest soared above what the security forces could cope: after uselessly trying to contain the wave of strikes and armed assaults, the Ukrainian authorities have ordered all military and administrative personnel to evacuate towards the East.\n\nWhile the reports of German settlers overloading ships in Crimea and fleeing towards Turkey are dismissed by the government as nonsense, there are no doubts about the seriousness of the situation. Should the Reich fail to restore order, the revolt may overwhelm Kiev and Eastern Ukraine, and in such case, German control over Eastern Europe will soon collapse."

speer_slaverevolt.13.desc:0 "With the fall of Poland to the slave revolt, and Ukraine is chaos, it was only a matter of time before the unrest spilled across the Vistula and up towards the North. While the German military managed to secure the lands directly bordering Eastern Prussia, they couldn't stray too far from the metropolitan Reich due to the risk of overextension: Letgallen was just outside the reach of the Wehrmacht, and local authorities barely had the time to evacuate to the military-controlled areas before the entire region was overrun by slave revolts.\n\nThe loss of this strategic region East of Riga opens the way for the revolt to reach the rest of the former Baltic Republics, where the recent civil war following the collapse Reichskommissariat Ostland has left many scars, some of which still aren't healed. The central government has started to debate the best solution to fight the uprising, but unless drastic measures are taken immediately, the situation will most likely continue, and infect even more regions."

When Latgale fell only a few days ago, the authorities had immediately begun preparations, requisitioning civilian ships docked at the port and loading them with documents, equipment and as many German civilians as possible: when the border patrols reported slave bands crossing the border of the administrative region, and unrest mounting in Reval itself, the evacuation began in earnest, and the enslaved laborers were freed mostly bloodlessly.\n\nEven though there haven't been episodes of violence against the German settlers yet, aerial reconnaissance missions show several armouries and police stations on fire, likely burned after all remaining weapons had been ransacked. With the Baltic region under rebel control, the Reich can no longer reinforce Belarus by land, which makes it the perfect candidate for the next stage of the uprising."

Slave camps and factories near Vitebsk erupted in violence almost at the same time, showing a degree of coordination unseen in other regions touched by the uprising: the security guards were either killed or forced to flee, and most of the administrative personnel was forced to flee overnight towards Moskowien, leaving precious supplies and documents in rebel hands.\n\nStill remembering the atrocities of the Ostland civil war, bands of slaves attacked both German settlers and Belarusian collaborators, with lynch mobs burning government buildings and police stations and sacking houses and stores owned by people connected to the German rule. As Eastern Europe finds itself embroiled in an unprecedented wave of chaos, the Reich must react quickly, or risk collapsing from the inside."

Weapons had been smuggled inside the labor camps around Minsk, and when night fell, the revolt erupted, taking the security by surprise: many were killed, and those who survived could only escape to the city and warn the administration. With barely enough time to gather their families, the officials were hurriedly evacuated alongside most of the garrison.\n\nWith the fall of Minsk, one of the main centers of German administration in Eastern Europe, the chain of command is quickly coming apart as the remaining minor administrations desperately try to save themselves from what is felt more and more like a looming doom. With most of the German Lebensraum lost, reports from the central government relay the worry over the dramatic increase of unrest in Germany itself."

Kiew, the main settlement in Ukraine, and largest industrial centre in the region, has fallen during the night as thousands of indentured laborers managed to free themselves and attacked the guards: the garrison desperately tried to hold the city, but they were only a few hundreds against tens of thousands. Faced with the prospect of having to fight to the death against a human wave, or call the Luftwaffe and burn the city to ashes to keep order, the commander chose retreat.\n\nWithin a few hours, the government and their families were evacuated to Crimea in a heavily-escorted convoy, immediately followed by most remaining German forces and all those who feared for their lives. Without a functioning administration, order across Ukraine is collapsing: while the revolt is yet to hit the Eastern part of the country, the Reich fears it will touch the Caucasus, one of the regions with the highest percentage of slaves in the entire Reich."

For Speer, it dawned on him when the reports began to slow and repeat themselves, a clear sign of a lack of new news. For the gang, it was when Speer's fiery outbursts cooled to a slow burning, controlled anger. For the people, it was when the news reports began to talk about how the Heer was "containing" the unrest. For Schorner, it was when his men stopped reporting casualty numbers from skirmishes with the Reichsbanner.\n\nYes, it was a peace- a shaky one, built only on the unwillingness of Germany to attack, but a peace. Soldiers on both sides dug in, from the forests of Lithuania to the fields of Ukraine. The Reichsbanner's rebellion had torn the Reich in half, literally- one half dominated by Schorner and his militarists, undoubtedly plotting for the final blow against Speer and his reformism. The other half digging in, trying to find some way to end the crisis before the winds of revolution spread further. Between them, a red strip of land, dominated by idealists, slaves, and students.\n\nIt was a powderkeg waiting to blow, but for now, the spark was not yet lit. As Speer downed another drink, he could only wonder how long this would last."

Katharinastadt, one of the main tungsten extraction sites in Kaukasien and home to dozens of slave mines, was awoken by the light of the fires burning camps and security buildings: the city fell in mere hours, almost half of the garrison slaughtered by the enraged rebels before they could secure an escape route for the administration and colonists.\n\nRefugees from the city report acts of extreme brutality against Germans in Katharinastadt, with lynch mobs seeking out anyone who worked as security or administrative personnel in the camps and exacting their vengeance on them for the years of suffering. With this sudden turn of events, Kaukasien finds itself in chaos as its main administrative center is now lost: German companies are squabbling to save their investments, and there are talks of private security forces desperately trying to keep order in the absence of official police."

With the city outskirts controlled by the rebels, the garrison could only evacuate the administration with the last train departing from the station directed towards Baku, where German forces, bolstered by growing numbers of security forces paid by the corporations, are still in control.\n\nDue to its proximity to Turkey, violence has been extremely low, with the slaves concerned by movements of Turkish troops along the borders. Since the Anatolian country has never entirely abandoned its claims over the region, there's fear that uncontrolled violence against could prompt the former Triumvirate member to cross the border to "protect" the large Turkish minority living in several towns near Kutnissi."

The oil fields in Machatschkala, despite being smaller than the ones in Aserbaidschan, are still very extensive, employing thousands of slaves to extract their black gold: during the night, rebels set the oil rigs on fire and attacked the security forces while they tried to extinguish the flames; with their stolen equipment, they attacked in great numbers military roadblocks and outposts, finally forcing a general retreat towards the South.\n\nWith Ostkaukasus lost, Baku is now completely isolated from the Reich, and kept afloat only through an air bridge linking its airport with Eastern Prussia. In this chaotic situation, worrying reports are filtering: they talk about hundreds of mercenaries reaching Aserbaidschan from Moskowien and by airplane, paid for by the corporations and led by a former SS-turned-mercenary called Otto Weidinger. These private soldiers are slowly forcing themselves inside the administration the more the garrison loses ground: if the central government doesn't act soon, they might soon be the only ones keeping order in the region..."

The city was evacuated soon after.\n\nAs the local administration and the remaining soldiers flee towards Moskowien to find refuge, the government in Germania reels from the hit. Now, almost all of Ukraine has fallen, with only the Southern part of the Reichsland under German control: as the security forces strengthen their defences, they can only prepare for what is perceived more and more as an imminent doom."

When the first uprisings began in the countryside, and smaller cells became active in the city itself, all valuable assets were evacuated by ship to Crimea, where the administration is trying to reorganize and resist.\n\nAs communications struggle to come to and from Germania, the situation grows even more difficult. If decisive action isn't taken immediately, the last of Ukraine may soon fall, and even the heavily-Germanized parts of the country are in danger: already barricades and trenches dot the Dnepr, manned by survivors from the garrison and local militias hastily risen from the population fearing violence from the slaves."

The Kriegsmarine patrols the coast in force, and the naval command of Theodericstadt has deployed elite marine detachments at key locations in the city: all guns and rifles are ready to open fire upon anyone foolish enough to threaten their home base, armed or not.

While most had thought these men were only paid by the corporations to protect the vital oil fields in the region, their presence had soon taken a more sinister meaning: day after day, the mercenaries and their enigmatic leader, a former SS-turned-mercenary named Otto Weidinger, took more and more power within the crumbling administration, taking advantage of the growing chaos to present themselves as the only ones with the means to protect Germany's interests.\n\nToday, in a shocking development, Weidinger's men stormed the main administrative compound and, after a brief firefight with the guards, took military control of the city. Baku's Gauleiter is currently being detained "for incompetence and corruption" until a "proper trial" can be held. The government in Germania immediately branded Weidinger's men as traitors and ordered their arrest, but even the Führer knows these are but empty words: with no way to transport troops to Baku due to the slave revolt, and the not-so-subtle threat of sabotaging the oil drills hanging in the air, the central government can only wait.\n\nSuspicions are arising, however, over a massive air lift paradropping weapons and supplies from Moskowien, paid for by corporations deeply tied to Abs, Flick and their clique of industrialists. While nothing is certain in these troubled times, few think this is a coincidence: questions will have answers in due time, and answers will prompt a response, the scope of which remains shrouded in the deepest darkness."

No longer shall Adolf Hitler's vile ideology spread any further, kill any more people!" A sort of frenzy of cheering was met in response, for but a moment drowning out the hopelessness and desperation. "I wish for you all to listen. I know of your hatred. All of it is deserved, all of it! To wish for my people to be thrown out of Europe for their crimes, but please- listen, listen to what I have to say! We must end this cycle of hatred here and now!" The cheering voices remained powerful, but quieter than before.\n\n"I know of a Germany - the true Germany, which the Nazis have attempted to eradicate," Brandt took in a deeper breath. "But it shall never die! The light of a democratic Germany can never be extinguished! There is a better future for Europe! We must not stand as slave and master, as Aryan and non-Aryan. We must stand as brother to brother, sister to sister, equal to equal! So please, on behalf of all of Europe, I beg you.

"Forgive us, oh, people of Europe, even if we do not deserve a shred of sympathy, those who know better will continue to fight for freedom." His voice trailed in strength and began showing cracks, and the air became stiff.\n\nWilly Brandt slowly landed on his knees, and bowed his head deeply. As the seconds passed, and nobody said anything, they could notice his frame shaking. And from the shaking, two tears dropped to the wooden platform. He expected the people to suffocate him with their silence, but as one man began to clap, so did ten, so did a hundred, so did a thousand. And as he looked up at those who dared to fight for their freedom, he let a wobbly smile come to his face."

When the judge asked him to bow, he kneeled.\n\n"The court hereby declares Willy Brandt to be a traitor to the Reich. The sentence is death."\n\nHe had been in a few trials during his life, but none were as short and as decisive as this. When two men approached him, he struggled against the handcuffs that forced him to his bench, and even spat out a curse to one of the men - it meant nothing, however. The bag was stuffy and hard to breathe in, and it was almost impossible to see out of it. He felt bitter when he figured out where they were going. Just like the family of the Tsar in Russia, they would take him to a basement and murder him in cold blood. No martyrization. No publicization.\n\nWhen Brandt's head slammed against the concrete wall, his vision swam, and he could feel warm blood seep through his hair. Weakly, his limbs struggled against each other, in a vain attempt to get on his feet, as all the joy and idealism in the world faded from him. This was a Willy Brandt whose light in the world had faded, and though he believed in a Germany free and happy, his efforts had been torn down to nothing.

I pick it because it is a holy place, and no holy place should be a battlefield for violence. I will also ask you another, perhaps more important thing. As a show of peace, I ask of you to come with only you and your diplomats. There is no need for guns to march between priests and crosses. I am uncertain if you shall follow through with this, but if you do, I will remain ever grateful for the move.\n\nAnd my final statement will be this. To Herr Speer, to you, Helmut Schmidt, to Ludwig Erhard, to Kurt Georg Kiesinger, to Henning von Tresckow. I should congratulate you all for taking Germany so far. It was as dark as shadows before, and for a while I had feared for its existence. But my hope has strengthened, and I am joyous that the free, humane, and democratic Germany still lives.

"I could not guarantee their safety, though there would be hell to pay if anyone decided to commit violence to them." Brandt let out a short laugh. "Good, good. Now, the final demand." He cleared his throat.\n\n"On the matter of repatriation. I demand that Germany begin immediate and extensive reparations to all slaves and their families. They will be compensated in full, as for the evil that the Reich has wrought on them must be cleansed, even if it will take decades for it to rinse away completely. The terms are non-negotiable, Herr Schmidt. Do you agree?"\n\nSchmidt blinked once or twice at the last demand. That would have put a major strain on Germany's budget, but... what right did he have to deny them that? It took him mere seconds to respond."

A pity though, because his interlocutor had none to spare for him: a laugh was the only answer to his pleas, one that had anything but mirth in it.\n"How entertaining! The proud Helmuth Schmidt is begging! If only you could be here in my office, I'd give half of the Reich, MY Reich, only to see your face!" came the Führer's voice.\n"I have always wanted to see the face a traitor makes when he's reduced to begging for his useless life! Not a big loss, though... Rewards come to the patient, and guess who I have right outside of my office?"\n\n"You wouldn't dare-"\n\n"That's right! The almighty Gang of Four! Ungrateful bastards, I saved you from Heydrich! I covered your crimes for years! You would be nothing without me, NOTHING! But now I can finally have my revenge. Sweet, sweet revenge, for all the humiliations, for all the times you threatened me, you sniveling wretches... Don't try to flee, little cheater, don't rob me of my pleasure: I'll find you and kill you even in Washington..." then the tone changed again, and Speer was laughing once more.\n"Enjoy your last hours, there are so many things you can do: hanging, poison, or the great classic, a bullet! Choose quickly, or I'll be the one to do it for you... Oh, before I forget: make yourself pretty, the ORPO is coming..."\n\nThe line went dead, but Schmidt was no longer focused on it. He was too terrorized to care about it, and not because of Speer's death threats: his fearful gaze was fixed on the mirror in front of him. His own reflection was staring at him, along with his father, and thousands of faces, all chanting the same word, over and over and over and over and over.\n"Traitor!" screamed his father, rage twisting his old face into a hate-filled grimace.\n"Traitor!" laughed his own reflection, blood gushing from a hole in his forehead.\n"Traitor!

No children played in the abandoned school: as the rabbi - an old man who had seen so much suffering and pain that God would have needed to build a new paradise just for him - once said, who would be so evil to let a child be born only to suffer?\n\nTherefore, it was with a heart as heavy as the gates of the ghetto that the rabbi listened to the unmistakable creaking sound, but when he looked outside, no one was there: in the place of the Germans was a poster.

Finally, he turned his head to the heavy gates that had been the end of their world for three decades, and he saw them open, the first ray of the morning sun carving a path to the exit: he knew it then, he knew how Moses had felt when the waters of the Red Sea had opened before him.

Schmidt gave a polite nod, and ushered him to continue. Wojtyła gave a light smile.\n\n"My son, I am sure you are aware that there cannot be peace in this... Einheitspakt of yours, unless its people are allowed to voice their opinions freely." Schmidt pressed his hands together. The worst was out of the way. Now came what he would call the 'secondary demands', and here he would have to weigh whether to hold back or push in. The priest continued. "I merely ask you this. Let them have their voices be heard. Many fight against it... the change that your Reich has brought. Not only in Germany, but everywhere else, too. I see them fighting for something better. The rest, I am sure, share my sentiments."\n\nThe rest - Brandt, Viacheslav, Nadezhda, all of them nodded silently. Schmidt, meanwhile, sighed. "I understand, Herr Wojtyła.

When the officer's hand disappeared under the desk, the small group trembled, but when it reappeared it held a small handbook with practical indications for the police: with a grimace, he read aloud.\n\n"Extract from the Law on Manifestation of Political, Social and Economical Thought, as approved by the Reichstag and published in the Reichsgesetzblatt [GetDateText].\nSection 1, Paragraph 1: "manifestation of political, social and economical thought is free in accordance of the provisions contained within this law"\nParagraph 2: "the conducts described in the above Paragraph are subject to authorization by the Ordnungspolizei"\nParagraph 3: "the conducts described in Paragraph 1, if lacking the authorization mentioned in Paragraph 2, are punishable according to administrative and criminal law"\nSection 2, Paragraph 1: "The authorization mentioned in Section 1, Paragraph 2 is to be requested to the local office of the Verwaltungspolizei within the Ordnungspolizeidivision district"\nParagraph 2: "the request must, under penalty of rejection, contain: A) exact itinerary of the manifestation; B) names of the promoters; C) insurance that the manifestation will not result in C1) violence; C2) illicit conducts; C3) delegitimation of the Reich and its organs"\n\nWith each word, the officer's frown deepened, but he knew his duty. When Gunther gave him the request, he examined it, and when at the third look he couldn't find anything illegal, he stamped it and put it in his desk.

More than anything, today we begin our road to redemption!"\n\nThe crowd could no longer be contained in the square, and the roads were filled with cheering people, men and women, young and old. The police managed to keep the people from reaching the ORPO station, causing several wounded, but this didn't change the results: they had been defeated. Perhaps it would take time , but their black uniforms would become a mere reminder of what had been, and would soon fade into the past.\n\nThe final moment of the rally was when the promoters read the names of those who had been killed during the past manifestation: "martyrs of freedom" whose names and deeds would "never be forgotten".

With a sigh, he spoke.\n\n"I agree on the part that the Reich can use more parties besides the NSDAP.

Her eyes narrowed towards Schmidt, and he felt the air tense. "Do you believe the words you speak, German? Or do you believe there may be something better? Go on, Helmut Schmidt. Speak freely.

"All this talk about slavery and laws and such is great, but there's something I've wanted to bring up. My dear home of Ukraine, you see, I've always felt like it's had so much potential."

There is nothing wrong."\n\nSpeer gave a nod. "That's very good. In that case, I figure that you already know what I'm going to ask of you, but, it's been long, long overdue. In fact, it's strange how I never..." He gave a short chuckle. "How I never thought of it in the first place. All I wish to do is one thing, going forward with our partnership.""

 speerreichsbanner.20.desc:0 "Schmidt had recently arrived back in Germania, and the return to the Reichskanzlei only filled him with dread. He did not know what to expect when he walked through that main door into the building. Many thoughts popped into his head. Most of them were a mixture between unpleasant and gruesome, leaning towards the latter. But Schmidt couldn't worry himself forever - he had to continue.\n\nSo when Schmidt entered the Reichskanzlei and stepped into the long, glossy hallway, the lights from the patterned glass above shone down into the room and illuminated none other than Albert Speer. Next to him were what he immediately recognized as members of the Ordnungspolizei. Schmidt almost mistook the skip of his heartbeat as a heart attack.\n\n"Herr Schmidt." His tone was a casual one, but Schmidt couldn't mistake the intention. It was as if Speer was the one in control here. "I'm ordering your immediate arrest. I suggest you do not flee." He was pressed into going on the backfoot. To turn and run - no, things were different now. It was no longer the Führer who had his strings attached everywhere he went. The situation had changed.\n\nHelmut Schmidt shook his head, and the Ordnungspolizei stopped moving towards him, standing halfway between Speer and Schmidt. "I'm afraid not, my Führer." He could already see the hatred begin to burn brighter in his eyes, and how his hands began trembling. "There will be no arrest. You should be aware that there is absolutely no reason why this order should be carried out. Do you have a reason, my Führer? You do not need one to arrest me, but you and I both know that doing so would cause your support to turn on you." Speer's whole body began shaking, and he breathed heavily.\n\n"Schmidt... for all these years..." With an unsteady hand, Speer reached into the coat he was wearing, and Schmidt's eyes widened. "I made sure to empty out the Reichskanzlei today. Just..."\n\n"No!" Schmidt shouted, and the Ordnungspolizei turned around, themselves spiking in fear as they saw the Führer draw a pistol.\n\n"Just s-so I could kill you."\n\n"SPEER!""

 speerreichsbanner.21.desc:0 ""Tell me, Schmidt."\n\nThe two of them had a discussion just minutes earlier about the Reichsbanner itself. Such a vigorous conversation it was - Schmidt found himself enthralled by all the information that Brandt had about it. Such a noble organization - in his mind, at least - stomped into the ground by the NSDAP, and then fading into irrelevance; and then, like a flash, it ruptured from its grave and returned as a major power, going head to head with Germany itself to negotiate the terms of freedom. Yet Schmidt had disappointed Brandt.\n\n"What is it, Brandt?"\n\nThey discussed the matters of protesting, too. Both men were in agreement about how important it was to showcase that the nation did allow itself to display that the people were free, that they had a voice. But what Schmidt differed from Brandt was how to go about it. Brandt scrutinized Schmidt for a while after they came to terms, to determine if he truly believed that the time for protesting was a transformation, a process that had to be carefully managed, or was it something else?\n\n"Are you a coward?"\n\nSchmidt felt the question was like a dagger pressed to his heart. He knew that Brandt had wanted to press him, but this... being so blunt and so direct contrasted the previous, friendly nature that the man had shown him. Doubt coursed through his mind, and as Brandt stared at him with that same look he gave after Schmidt offered his suggestion of a compromise, words failed him momentarily. What was dry air that came out of his mouth was then replaced by what he would call a realization. After nigh ten seconds of silence, Schmidt spoke."

 speerreichsbanner.22.desc:0 "From the top floor of the St. Alexander's Church, Schmidt could see all the people passing about. So many of them armed with weapons that dated back to the Second World War, and though he could spot a few that carried guns which were likely stolen from armories or taken from the hands of the local guards, it was like watching a ragtag group of rebels rather than anything that resembled a proper army. And while so many looked sad, bitter, depressed, even - so many more were happy, overjoyed, clinking glasses with one another and sitting around and sharing stories, tales, poems, confessions.\n\n"Schmidt..." The slurred voice of Willy Brandt alerted Schmidt to his presence, and he turned his head to see the revolutionary smile tiredly towards him. "I'm... glad you listened." The shot glass in his hand was unsteady as he dangled it over the edge of the church's top floor. Then Brandt turned from looking at Schmidt to looking at the city. "I was w-worried, frankly, that- well, no need to bring your spirits down. You want a drink, Schmidt?" A distinct lack of 'Herr', but neither man seemed to mind.\n\nHesitance painted his words. "... Sorry, Herr Brandt. Not much of a drinker. I'm also a diplomat, and diplomats should probably lay off the alcohol," he said, pointedly giving a half-serious glare towards Brandt, who looked at him with a smile that cracked into grin after a few seconds. Schmidt himself eventually gave a smirk.\n\n"Quit staring at me like that, Schmidt, it's-" He gave out a short laugh. "Stop!" Schmidt could feel his own lips quivering, and, perhaps to save face or just to listen to Brandt's demands, he turned away before he succumbed to Brandt finding it funny. "You know, Schmidt... you might still be a Nazi in the eyes of the people, but to me, you're... you're a better man than anyone in Germania's high castle."\n\nSchmidt suddenly felt a pang of embarrassment. A strong fear and source of doubt kept pulling at his consciousness - that he would be cast down into the annals of history as a traitor and a Nazi. Maybe it was true; maybe, once he finally died and fulfilled his role, his role would be that of a forgotten soldier. But if at least one person knew, just one, then..."

The piano overlapped with itself, and Grigory could picture it.\n\nRubble that crushed men and women without care, and soldiers digging shallow ditches and riddling children full of holes.

He could barely contain himself after the speech was finished. Those violent thoughts he had, of slaves being gunned down, men dying by the droves, now had become reality. Did they deserve it? Perhaps not. Perhaps they merely did not know better, and thought that violent uprising was a smarter solution that to remain put and loyal like good subjects of the Reich. It didn't matter now.

After struggling to read a few paragraphs over and over, trying to remember and understand the words written out in front of him, he let out a frustrated sigh and set it down against the table. What had happened gnawed at his mind. Of everything that he was expecting Albert Speer to do... of everything that could have happened, he had decided to risk everything just so that he could have a shot at fulfilling his revenge. A fool. A madman. That's what Speer was.\n\nThe knocks on his door jolted him awake, and though he was initially gripped by fear, he quickly steadied his nerves, making himself comfortable in his seat and giving a quick roll of his shoulders as two men came in. He had called them in this morning, and, now that they had finally arrived, Schmidt could calm his own worries somewhat. With a sharp, professional tone, he addressed them both.\n\n"For your silence, expect your paychecks to be increased significantly. In return, I want not a word of this to escape anywhere.

The things Erik had to do to join this newly-formed anti-terrorist group made him regret coming, but how could he back out now?\n\nWith the swastika emblazoned on his urban camouflage clothing, a variety of utilitarian tools at his side and a rifle that slung over his back, he and a couple of other RSG-9 members had hastily exited their barracks and made their way to an abandoned two-story house that was repurposed as a building to practice hostage rescue scenarios. It was deep into the night when they pulled up and prepared themselves, reciting through the countless hours of forced listening they had to go through.\n\nThat brought him here. When Erik kicked in the door, he felt his head go light, but procedures had to be followed, and through the pain that pulsed across his body, the headache that made his mind feel raw and vulnerable, and the resulting gunshots that rung his ears as he screamed out methodical orders to both would-be terrorists and his own two men, he wondered to himself; wandering through with gun and flashlight, nerves frayed yet still on edge - what would his skills be pressed for? The former slaves? The students? ANTIFA? None seemed particularly dangerous, yet Erik was put through hell for a reason only the higher-ups would know. He could only theorize one answer."

With his genius, Germany pulled itself out of the rubble and soared once again. Then came all of his reforms, as dangerous as they were, as utterly maddening it was to many, it worked. Too well, in fact.\n\nNothing good can last forever. Germany's economy was strong, but built on glass links. It was a powerhouse, yet when the oil crisis had come to strike Germany, it bled like a stuffed pig, too weak to fend itself as it relied on its shared feed. Not only that, people were waking up to the fact that not all was well. They would demand change, and if there was anything Erhard hated, it was his efforts being undone.\n\nWith a sigh, Erhard shut the lights to the bathroom and prepared to go to sleep; his mind was overfilled with thoughts, though he knew that there was always more work to be done.

For the sake of 'stability' and 'diversifying the strengths of National Socialism'. Vague nothingness like that. He felt the slightest bit of irritation, but, what could he do? Though he had his fair share of connections, nothing could stand up to Speer's decision.\n\nLudwig Erhard groaned when he had read the letter that arrived at his table. Speer's antics had cropped up once more. Now he was to be the co-Minister of Economics and Labor. What nonsense was this? Did Speer think so little of his efforts to brighten the future of Germany's economy - and succeeding heartily, at that - only to be forced to share space with what was likely some faceless bureaucrat? He would have marched into Speer's office then and there upon receiving the news, but... his friends within the Reich dwindled, and he knew what Speer was doing, and Speer knew what he was doing.\n\nHelmut Schmidt felt his teeth grind together when he was approached by a messenger. His position as Minister of Foreign Affairs would now have to be effectively separated in two, listening and consulting with another Minister who would effectively serve as an equal co-partner. When he heard the name, Schmidt knew nothing of whoever this person was, and that's when it had hit him. With this one, simple move, Schmidt's power within the cabinet was cut in half.

Germany's territorial expansion bloomed - so much territory, so densely packed, so rich with people, industry and resources, it filled him with a sense of joy, that the Reich truly was the dominator of Europe.\n\nBut the Gang of Four had forced his hand into doing something that he was never truly satisfied with. The Reichskommissariats were an inefficient thing, a product of a past era - riddled with corruption and slavery. He could understand the concerns of some with the concept of the Reichsländer, but to Speer, the idea was such that he couldn't possibly pass it by. Direct subjects of the Reich, with a vague semblance of freedom; while they would never officially undergo the process of Germanization, seeing that it was well and truly too expensive and risky of a process, they would still be influenced by German civilization.\n\nThat night Speer had decided. The collaborationists had to go. The natives wouldn't be pleased with it, and he would have to make it a slow process, but he knew, in his heart, that this would be better for all. For the Reich to receive its just rewards of victory, and for the men and women of the East to be taught their place.

He found it beautiful, yes, but there were so many other things that had occupied his time that he could not spare a visit to it. Now, however, he felt at ease. When Adolf Hitler had died, his body had been transported to Germania and been given a proper burial and a memorial service even as the civil war had raged on - but Speer, with his personal funds, and over the course of the decade, had asked, petitioned, and convinced for the body of Hitler to be moved to Linz. His love of the city was strong, and in turn, so was Speer's.\n\nNot only that, however. His body did not deserve to be in a mere grave to rot. Instead, Speer had built a mausoleum for his predecessor, and he had meticulously planned every inch of it. As he stood in front of the tomb that housed his paternal figure, he smiled. Everything about it was right. All the details, the vaguely religious yet still National Socialist elements that covered the inside. Perhaps, in a way, this was his greatest work yet - barring Germania, of course.\n\nBut he hadn't come merely to admire his own architectural genius. No, there was something more. There was a man he had respected for as long as he had lived, and now he had passed. Yet Speer never truly gave him the proper respect he deserved. For without him, there would be no Reich to begin with - but without Speer, the Reich would not have survived. As he kneeled in front of the tomb, he uttered no prayer, he made no motion of bowing to a deity. Instead, his was a silent admiration of the highest degree.\n\nEverything Albert Speer had learned from his father was now passed on to him, yet reshaped, moulded to serve the rapidly-changing future. Would he have understood it? Speer wouldn't know; but he would have respected him. For now there was no need to play nice with the enemies of the Reich. Power was his, and no other's. He was the NSDAP, and the NSDAP was his. A sort of tingling pride was felt in him, a sensation that he was, as treacherous as it would have been to say, an even better leader than he who had guided him all those years.

Perhaps he was afraid of coming back to it and to be swallowed in its memories, as then and even now, there was no time to afford for traces of weakness. But things had changed. Things were different now. As Schmidt walked through the rich morning of the city, where his eyes would have focused on vain, oversized Nazi banners were residents in apartments living out their daily lives; where he would see soldiers patrolling the streets, there were men and women fighting for a better Germany. Raising the banner of freedom, to voice their anger in protests that shook the city's peace.\n\nThe city was no longer familiar to Schmidt, but nostalgia still pulled him inwards. Hitler and his regime had built it up in such a way that even when he had visited Barmbek, the old village where he spent his childhood days, there was barely anything that resembled what he had known for two decades, and he had walked through it like he would have any other district. There was one place, however, that would remain unchanged - and it was just next to Barmbek.\n\nThe Außenalster always remained the same. He knew the Nazis couldn't have tainted its water. Somewhere along the coast, Schmidt had stood at the edge of the water and stared as all the sailing boats passed. He remembered being on one with his father as a child, demanding to go back in and loop around when they were done. Now there were so many others. People, sometimes alone and sometimes together, and sometimes with their children, enjoying themselves in a way that was now alien to him. Yet the air was so much lighter now. Ten years since Schmidt had entered into the dark tunnel, the light had begun to pour in. So much fear, so much anxiety, contrasted by the serenity of the peace that he felt while in Hamburg.\n\nSchmidt looked down at his arm. That bright, burning reminder that seared his flesh and assaulted his mind whenever he looked at it. The armband he wore that was a constant reminder that he deserved to be afraid, deserved to die. But no more would he force himself to follow the orders of a mad man. He had done what many could never do. He did not feel prideful for it, as a man who dodges a death sentence would feel proud about avoiding the inevitable. Instead, as his fingers tugged under the fabric, and it slid across his arm, he felt relief. Sheer, unmitigated relief.\n\nWhen the armband slipped from his wrist and slid against and out from the grasp of his fingers and landed in the water with a silent thump, Schmidt breathed. Everything felt so much clearer than it did before. He could finally live. His judge, jury, and executioner would never pursue him again. But there was work to do, and so Schmidt turned around and began walking. He knew what he had to do."

They existed only to expand their influence and combat their enemies, as peace was hardly seen as a viable alternative in the years following Germany's glorious triumph. Yet now, decades later, we see that there is something new brewing.\n\nThe Oil Crisis has struck the world as a knife to exposed flesh. It has exploited the weakness found in all of the blocs that encompass the world, every superpower attempting to take it on by themselves, only to find that such a course of action is not only inefficient, but actively detrimental.\n\nAlong with it, the revolt of the slaves has shown Germany that it cannot stand alone. We have made token efforts to appease the other two superpowers, true, but it is finally time for the Reich to stand together in full earnest with the rest. The Einheitspakt cannot be solely Germany and its puppets. It can be more. For the good of the world, it must be."

 speerphase3.13.desc:0 "REPORT ON THE STATE OF JAPAN\nAUSWÄRTIGES AMT\n\nThe Empire of Japan is beginning to crumble. As the Co-Prosperity Sphere enters into the 1970s, it has had a very weak start. With the intensive modernizations of China, they are rapidly beginning to climb to the status of a co-equal partner within the Sphere. An insight into Japanese politics tells us that there is heavy friction about the idea that China could ever possibly be anything more than a puppet to the Sphere, and thus their internal stability is beginning to fall.\n\nIt's advised to pursue stronger diplomatic and trade relations with the Organization of Free Nations - particularly the U.S. The state of their internal politics is much stronger than that of Japan, and they have a massive and still growing economy that we could expand our interests into, as well as having a large surplus of raw and refined goods. Also, China is a nation with a vast, untapped population, industrial potential, and common outlook. Advised to form interests with them as well. More information about interactions between Japan and China can be found in pg. 1 to 15. End of page."

 speerphase3.14.desc:0 "To the esteemed [THIS.GetLeader] of the [THIS.GetName], the Greater German Reich has formed a proposal.\n\nDecades have passed since the war that ravaged the planet, and we all have begun the process of healing, recovering, and advancing from it. In this new era, our nations have prospered. But a new problem has developed. As the world has grown richer, more connected with each other, we now run the risk of collapse. The Oil Crisis struck not only Germany, but the world as a whole, and it has ripped open a hole we never thought had existed before.\n\nThe Greater Germanic Reich proposes that a new organization be formed. One that would have the intent of safeguarding peace across the planet, as war only serves to further destroy the economies of the nations affected. It would also serve as a way to bring all of our nations closer - think of it as global cooperation. The name of it is simple; the Koalition der Nationen. Currently there are no concrete plans to establish one, but the Reich has shown a keen interest in the idea. We ask you this:\n\nAre you of the same mind?"
 speerphase3.14.a:0 "It is an interesting idea, at the least."

 speerphase3.15.desc:0 "The Führer did not bend. Or did he?\n\nWhen word came - the Americans and the Japanese have shown interest, more specifically, it was as if a dim light sparked with life once more in his mind. He never truly was a fan of war. It was a costly affair. A glorious one, you could say, but look where it led the reich to. Men like Bormann, men like Göring...\n\nMen like Heydrich.\n\nSpeer shuddered. What visceral carnage they would have wrought upon the Reich. They were long gone now, however. Only phantoms. And with the Gang of Four out of his way, and the NSDAP following his will and his voice, he would make the finishing touches to his precious Reich - his final test, that came not in the form of a revolt, or dealing with dissent. It came as a goal to secure the future of the Thousand Year Reich.\n\nThe Koalition der Nationen transcended all of his previous architectural goals. Germania would be merely a backdrop in comparison as to what will come. Albert Speer's will was powerful, and after having dealt with the brunt of the Reich's issues all at once, he pulled out victorious. This time, however, he would have to cement his legacy forever. The KdN in Speer's mind would not only certify Germany's dominion over Europe.\n\nIt would seat them as the leader of the world. The greatest house that Albert Speer would begin crafting started now."

Kiesinger withdrew his thumb and put his hands together. "I'll be looking forward to help develop this idea. We should be working as close as possible to get a theoretical framework of what a Koalition would look like, make certain to the other two superpowers that it would be worth their time joining. However..." Kiesinger let a second or two of silence pass before he continued. "Herr Speer, Helmut. He's a volatile element."\n\nAs Schmidt took in his words, he momentarily closed his eyes and thought. Then, he shook his head. "No," he began with a sigh. "Speer is quite the stable substance, I would say." Kiesinger looked at him with suspicion, but Schmidt's in return glowed with confidence. "I have seen him at his very worst, Kurt. He is nothing but a hollow shell of a man. He is a liar, a coward, a thief, and an architect of nothing but murder. To name any positive traits about him would be deluding myself. To your eyes, that would make him unstable. But to me..." Schmidt turned around in his chair and looked to the window outside. "He is the perfect puppet."\n\nKiesinger froze up for a moment. He hadn't expected the man who grazed death under the presence of the Führer to so openly denigrate him. "So you have no worries, then. I see. A question, however." Schmidt made no motion to decline answering. "Would you dare say this all to his face? If he is such a weak puppet, then you would get away with doing so."\n\nSchmidt's stoic frown cracked, and he gave a small smile.

speerescalation.4.desc:0 "Germany's forefathers, the norse Aryans of the North, believed that one day Götterdämmerung, or Ragnarök, would envelop the world. The first sign of this end of days would be when a great Wolf, Garmr, broke free from his chains and was set loose. Following this, countryman would turn on countryman. Brother on brother. Earth would be torn asunder.\n\nHe had left it too late. He had not put Garmr back in chains. No, he had been a fool. An idiot, all things considered. That devil in the east, Schörner, was a rabid dog in every sense of the word. Foul, vicious and savage. Speer knew that when an animal goes feral, there is only one humane choice, for it and for all around it: putting the dog down. Yet he hadn't. Out of some fear, or stupid sympathy, or pure idiocy, Speer had led the dog roam free. Now, he had to endure the reports as they came in, live through that newfangled television of his.\n\nMurder. Massacre. Wholesale slaughter of slaves in the East. Was this Speer in the mirror? Was Schörner just a reflection of the great architect? When he looked at the white marble of Germania, would Speer see anything in his own artistry but the bloodied tapestry of sinews that the Generalfeldmarschall had constructed across the Reichskommissariats? And it was a tapestry. Slavic bodies flung carelessly around. Mass graves dug. Who knows how many thousands more will be killed in the coming weeks? Schörner had what he wanted. The dog was putting his master down.\n\nHe had lost. Now, he would be a Führer only in name. With the students nearing rebellion, the slaves openly revolting, and Speer's underlings turning against him, he felt his dreams disappear. He stood up from his desk, and stood in front of one of the many bookshelves of the Kanzler's office. The Poetic Edda stood out to him. He smiled, with a hint of melancholy. How fitting. He turned to stanza forty-five, and read aloud, alone in the room.\n\n"Brothers shall fight and fell each other, \nand sister's sons shall kinship stain. \nHard is it on earth, with mighty whoredom. \nAxe-time, sword-time, shields are sundered, \nWind-time, wolf-time, 'ere the world falls.""

speerescalation.7.t:0 "Looking Forwards"
speerescalation.7.desc:0 "As a man endures his sixties, he begins to ponder his life. In Germany, most men retire during this twilight decade, putting down the hammers and quills and moving into a life of family and comfort. The free men do, anyway.\n\nKurt's father had been a free man. For him, sixty was only the two-thirds checkpoint in his life, and he lived a happy final third with the wealth of a bank clerk. A shining example of the protestant work ethic, and a reaper of its rewards. He'd only died recently, Kurt remembered. Was it just last year? Time seemed a blur nowadays.\n\nKurt wasn't a man built for retirement. If time was a blur, his duty was not. With the Führer occupied in Moskowien, the student protests continued to cripple the heart of the Reich, and the old Silver Tongue was not about to let the opportunity for a reformed Germany descend into chaos and violence so quickly. Fingers drum on the table as the Deputy Führer stares coldly into middle distance, listening. The sound of a phone being picked up, and Kiesinger begins.\n\n"These lines are not secure, so I shall keep it brief. You know the location already. Where the griffin flies and the seas are sweet with trade. Next Thursday, be at the pier. Let us keep this brief."\n\nAnd like that, Kiesinger hung up the phone. His suitcase for an overnight stay had already been prepared in his room. A plane for Rostock had been organised, and if the Führer couldn't quell the Devil, then his Deputy would have to make a pact himself."

speerescalation.9.t:0 "House of Cards"
speerescalation.9.desc:0 "To Erhard, it appeared as if the house of cards was finally collapsing. Was Speer more tolerable than the Nazi scum before him? Of course. Was his demise in any way an upset to the Minister for the Economy? Not in the slightest. As the Führer's crisis continued to worsen, the man behind the facade of kindness and polite diplomacy had shrunk away, and the demon that Erhard had always seen behind those glassy eyes and forced smiles had reared its ugly head. Unfortunately for Ludwig, the time was not yet right for him and his allies to wrestle a true liberal democracy out of the ruins of the Reich.\n\nIn this sense, the student protests had seemed a tragedy to him. Slavery, tyranny, state control; all valid causes to rally against, and ideals he sympathised with. This particular outburst at the obvious violence of the regime Erhard was forced to collaborate with and the slave uprisings shook the economic minister to his core. Behind his crassness, he had a heart. In front of his crassness, Erhard cringed at the economic stupidity of this Nazi institution and the untold prosperity it had denied Germany.\n\nFor now, Erhard did need to calm the students. Their violent responses, although understandable, were ultimately a hindrance to the obtaining of genuine reform in the Reich. His political invulnerability would be his weapon.\n\nCalls were made, and meetings arranged. Erhard had sent his sympathies out through the protests, spreading rumours that he, and others within the government, were allied with them in the struggle for reform. By dispelling this information secretly, Erhard was gambling on the news not being traced back to him, and that if it was, his importance to the Reich might guarantee immunity from punishment. In time, however, this regime and all it stood for would be erased."

speerescalation.11.t:0 "A New Deal"
speerescalation.11.desc:0 "Germania was called the Welthauptstadt for a reason. If Tokyo, sprawling metropolis of the isles to the East, was the capital of an Empire, then Germania in its size and magnificence was the capital of the world. The massive projects and renovations of old Berlin, and especially the expansion into a surrounding urban sprawl, gave the city plenty of hiding spots, however. The larger a house is, the harder it is to clean, and the dirty corners of the Reich's basement saw little light throughout the decades.\n\nHelmut entered an alley in a local downtown area of Germania's surrounding suburbs. He was dressed quite carefully in a black leather coat over a dark brown jumper. A fedora adorned his head and he wore dark eye glasses, not tinted enough to suggest sunglasses at midnight but not light enough to see his eyes. The outfit was a precautionary measure against the foreign minister being identified in the outer suburbs of his home city.\n\nTwo other men and a woman were already in the alley. They were young, and even in the cover of night, their clothes told their age. Effortful. Jazzy. American. Even as a liberal, Helmut grimaced at the sight.\n\n"Finally. What have you got for us, old man," the woman began.\n\n"Naught but a promise, I'm afraid," Helmut responded. "I cannot get you what you want now, but I can guarantee it comes in due time."\n\n"What kind of a deal is that?" The men tensed, an effort to threaten the aging statesman.\n\n"A deal you'll have to take, my dear, if you want anything done in this wretched country." Schmidt revealed a note from his pocket. "This is the address of a cache of weapons I redirected from some friends in the Heer. They're not for use in some violent rebellion; I want you to know I am on your side and will defend you from this police state I have found myself in. There's more where they come from, when the time comes, but for now I need you to lower tensions and engage in talks with the state. It is the only choice."\n\nThe woman grimaced, but nodded. "Thank you, Herr Schmidt.""

speerescalation.13.t:0 "Wisdom"
speerescalation.13.desc:0 "Hegel, as a young man, described Napoleon entering the city of Jena as the 'world's soul on horseback'. The man was a hero, despite his crimes, and burned with the energy and charisma that galvanised his country behind him. It seemed to Hegel as if history itself had volunteered for his army. If the philosopher had been a young man today, a student on the sidelines of Frankfurt's protests, perhaps he would have had some similar esteem for the world soul arriving in an armoured car instead.\n\nVon Tresckow arrived in the city with the Orpo. He wore his military uniform that day, iron cross and all, with a furred coat over the top. An imperial elegance held to the Old Prussian. He had not come to fight, he had come to talk.\n\nOver the past few years, Von Tresckow had used his time to reform the police. Primarily, this involved reallocating resources away from weaponry, reducing their numbers, revising tactics and educational programs. Perceptions of Germany's Prussian tradition often confuse traditionalism and patriotism with militarism and dogmatism. Von Tresckow knew that the military and nation were central to a German identity, but they were a restrained force of honour and valor meant to protect freedom, not crush it.\n\nHe was to be an ambassador. Schmidt might have dealt well in foreign embassies, but Von Tresckow had always felt a bond with all common people. These protestors were no different.\n\nAs the Orpo began to form a wall around the students, they screamed in the officers face. This was an expected activity, and the police stood firm, but calm, as they had been trained to do. When Von Tresckow was spotted amongst their ranks, the face of Germany's security ministry became the target of even more verbal abuse. He understood their anger, and despite the protests of some of his own men, he stepped beyond the police barrier into the crowd.\n\n"Germans, gather round. I come not to make war, I come not to preach the Nazi ideal. I came to make peace, I came to listen to the people. So, brothers and sisters, speak."\n\nAnd so they did, until the final of the sun's rays died on the horizon."
