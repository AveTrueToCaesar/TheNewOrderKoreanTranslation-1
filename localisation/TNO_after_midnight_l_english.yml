 AM_salted_earth_desc:0 "섭정의 신성 러시아 제국이 전러시아를 가로질러 남긴 흔적은 소금에 절여진 땅과 황폐한 들판으로, 이는 통일 과정에서 저항세력과 적들을 상대로 분사된 방대한 양의 화학 무기가 남긴 유산입니다. 이러한 이유로, 막대한 양의 토지가 독에 절여지게 되었고, 중요한 상수도가 모두 독에 절여졌으며, 숲은 벌거벗겨졌습니다. 휘황찬란했던 조국에는 이제 음식과 물이 전혀 없으며, 전러시아가 그로 인하여 고통받고 있습니다."

 WRS_impossible_position:0 "상상조차 할 수 없는 위치"

 VOL_fraying_strings:0 "닳아 해진 끈"
 VOL_fraying_strings_desc:0 "협력단은 명목상 동쪽의 섭정국의 구성 요소이지만, 대세가 이미 기울었음을 파악한 그들은 라리오노프의 죽어가는 재앙에게 벗어나기 위해 노력하면서 그저 립서비스만 보내는 등 근본적으로 독립적으로 운영되고 있습니다."

 NIK_hermit_kingdom:0 "은둔의 왕국"
 NIK_hermit_kingdom_desc:0 "러시아를 통일하고 제국을 회복하려는 그의 원대한 비전에도 불구하고, 사실, 라리오노프의 신성 러시아 제국은 오로지 두려움과 부에 대한 약속으로 충성을 지키고 있는 고갈된 군대에 의해 지켜지는 버림받은 국가에 불과합니다. 라리오노프의 제국은 러시아의 나머지 지역으로부터 격리되어 있으며, 다른 군벌들과의 유일한 교류는 습격과 통신을 통한 위협 뿐입니다."

 SAM_blessed_isolation:0 "복된 고립"

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_ZINOVIEV_AM_DESC:0 "An opponent of the USSR during its existence, Alexander Alexandrovich Zinoviev is a man with philosophical inclinations, who has nonetheless been spurred into action in his country's time of need. Nearly conscripted during the first war with the Germans, the USSR fell before he could be brought to the front. Zinoviev made his way to the newly established Central Siberian Republic in the aftermath, seeing it as a beacon of relative tolerance and stability, and joined the Bastillard society, rising to an undistinguished position in their leadership. With the rest of the leadership of the Bastillards dead or missing as a result of the vicious purges of the Empire, he has taken charge of the rebuilding of Tomsk, large portions of which were leveled by imperial forces. Deeply haunted by the devastation of the Modernist and Humanist societies, Zinoviev is very willing to compromise in order to ensure the continuation of much needed stability."

Unfortunately, Safa Gaziz is now but a reflection of the Mad Regent's reign of terror.\n\nOriginally a minor NKVD officer of the Kazakh SSR before the Soviet Union's demise, Safa led a relatively quiet life prior to Taboritsky's reign of terror in Kazakhstan. Under the Holy Russian Empire's occupation of his homeland, Gaziz led a group of raiders and partisans, wreaking havoc in the countryside against Russian forces.\n\nAs time went on, his hatred for the Russians and Slavs as a whole grew, removing the "-ov" Russian suffix of his surname as a sign of rejecting any Slav cultural influence.

Through this, he came to be elected by the unified councils of the Free Kazakh Clans at their first gathering following the fall of Taboritsky's regime.\n\nA beacon of hope in these war-torn lands, Sultanakhmet will lead his people towards a better tomorrow, one where their way of life is no longer threatened.

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_KARDASHEV_AM_DESC:0 "Once a brilliant physicist working to ensure the continuation of Russian scientific advancement even as the land fell into anarchy, Nikolai Semenovich Kardashev was finally sent to a death camp just before the death of Taboritsky. After escaping in a large prison uprising occurring in the chaos that followed, Kardashev went to Chelyabinsk, located nearby the camp that once held him, and found a society of scientists and researchers already working in hiding to build a better society out of the inevitable ashes. Quickly taking charge of this group, Kardashev used his excellent administrative skills to attract other intellectuals as well as partisans and former NKVD officers to serve as security forces. As a result of his hard work in developing this haven for progress, he was elected Director of the Chelyabinsk Institute by his colleagues."

 POLITICS_ANDRONIY_MISHURENKO_AM_DESC:0 "Androniy Afanasyevich Mishurenko is the leader of an all-new Black Army that rules over what remains of the wastes of Siberia. After the horrors of the Mad Regent, Mishurenko stoked the flames of internal dissent within the remnants of the Siberian Black Army, breaking off the Bratsk Communal Vanguard under his personal protection. Now, his warriors ride about the desolate remains of the countryside, tasked with securing order in the communes. He claims to be the true heir to the Black Army, a personal protector of anarchist ideals and a warrior for equality, forced into his despotic position by the circumstantial horror of the Holy Russian Empire. Most, however, see him as little more than a bandit king with delusions of grandeur."

 POLITICS_ALEXEI_II_AM_DESC:0 "Who is he? A man? A god? An idea? Each Russian has their own answer, Taboritsky's Imperial Cult having stained Alexei's name into the collective consciousness of the Russian people. Many understand him as the nightmare, the final end that awaits them all. Others, styling themselves as more rational than the rest, view him as naught but a name, used to justify the most horrid of crimes. But to some, he is the avenging angel of the people; the light, the guide, the savior of Russia.\n\nHe watched as his people slaughtered each other in his absence, saw the rise of the Reichsadler and the fall of the motherland, and wept as the Regent, the wretched despoiler of all Creation, plunged Russia into its darkest chapter. His people find themselves broken and beaten, with no hope of recovery. They till ravaged fields, eat poisoned food, and salt the earth further with their tears. Russia calls out in agony for something to save it from destruction; the voices of suffering millions begging the void for someone to bring them salvation.\n\nAnd finally, Alexei answered.\n\nBorn Michael Goleniewski, he has seen the triumph of Nazism everywhere it has stepped foot. His Polish homeland fell in mere weeks, the Union didn't last a year, and even the Americans surrendered before the power of the atom. His heart lies with the people, socialistic tendencies bleeding into his governance as tsar.\n\nBut he is no extremist. Russia has suffered more than any people ought to; dying three times in under a century, each more brutal than the last. Now is not the time for ideology or division. Russia needs to be reborn once more, and Michael will take up the mantle of its phoenix.\n\nGod has not seen fit to help Russia, but Alexei lives, and he loves his subjects."

 POLITICS_ANATOLY_SOBCHAK_AM_DESC:0 "For every hundred tales of loss and sorrow, there's one of survival that gives the faintest glint of hope in what often seems to be a doomed land. The story of Anatoly Aleksandrovich Sobchak is one of those tales.\n\nFormerly involved in the monarchist White Movement in Chita during the early 60s, he was mayor of the major Far Eastern city. When the Whites were on the brink of defeat, he fled the city with a meager handful of friends, first into the Siberian wilderness before covertly slipping over the border to Manchukuo. When he was there, he helped rebuild whatever sort of a Russian expatriate community was left in Harbin.\n\nWhen news arrived in the Manchurian city that the "Blessed Regent" had died and that his empire was rapidly crumbling, Anatoly Aleksandrovich made one of the hardest decisions of his life: he went back.\n\nCrossing the Amur with no more than two dozen followers, Sobchak founded what he called the Amur Refugee Zone, swearing that he will use his international connections in the Sphere and the West to bring in all the foreign aid he could to what few people remained in Eastern Siberia. Sobchak has dedicated his life to an attempt at alleviating the vast suffering that has been inflicted upon the Far East."

 POLITICS_HADJI_UMAR_MAMSUROV_AM_DESC:0 "Even as Hadji-Umar Dzhiorovich Mamsurov leads a nation, his heart still screams in defeat.\n\nIn a better time, Mamsurov was a commander in the Ural League, protecting his people from the tides of tyranny that had surrounded them. When Taboritsky's men invaded, Mamsurov fought to the end, but to no avail. As Mamsurov lost contact with battalion after battalion, the truth gradually became clear to him - the Ural League was gone, and his men were alone.\n\nWith the Guard's destruction, many lost hope and surrendered to the Regent and his madmen. Yet Mamsurov did not - could not - let go of the dream. As the Empire rose and fell, Mamsurov and his band of partisans never ceased their struggle. Years later, when Taboritsky's death tore apart the Empire, Mamsurov at last returned to liberate whoever could be saved from the madness to come.\n\nWith the partisans victorious, Mamsurov has certainly spared some precious few - but he is certain he could have done more. The Urals' new leader still sees visions of the world he promised his people, where his men beat back Taboritsky and saved the land to which they were sworn. But there is no time for regret. The Urals need a new protector, one strong enough to save them from any foe. As Mamsurov walks through empty villages and charred forests, he is certain that this duty falls to him."

 POLITICS_YEVGENIYA_TARATUTA_AM_DESC:0 "A former member and ideologue of the old Siberian Black Army, Yevgeniya Aleksandrovna Taratuta survived the purges imposed by the empire on her fellow anarchists, and came out of the experience more determined than ever to free the Russian people from the chains of the state, having witnessed firsthand the depths to which a government could sink. Having rallied those of her old allies that remained, Taratuta seeks to restore the Free Territory as it once was, a beacon of freedom in a land in desperate need of it. She will show the world that Russia can be free, can rise above the depredations of the Holy Russian Empire, or die trying."
 
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_PERVUKHIN_AM_DESC:0 "No amount of reactionary thuggery could ever extinguish the flame of Bolshevism in Russia, and Mikhail Georgiyevich Pervukhin is living proof of that.\n\nWith the death of Kaganovich and subsequent collapse of the Tyumen government, Pervukhin followed his last orders and led the last few Stalinists on an odyssey towards the Southern Urals. There, he found fertile ground for a revolution, which he planned for and organized from a mountain hideout, in expectation of the moment for Taboritsky's reactionary monstrosity would finally collapse. When that day came, the Bolshevik coup was swift, and General Secretary Mikhail Pervukhin was sworn in as chairman of the Orenburg Revolutionary Communes.\n\nIn other circumstances, it is likely that a regime so fanatically dedicated to the ideals of the late Kaganovich would be intolerable to any population that aspires to a dignified living. In fact, there could scarcely have been a less-fertile breeding ground for a dictatorship of the proletariat as totalitarian as Pervukhin's, than the patchwork former anarchist villages around Orenburg. Such was the extent of sheer oppression practiced by Taboritsky's men, that an eventuality so unlikely became first a foretold certainty, and then a fact. Indeed, for many whom just a decade earlier professed an unbound love of liberty and freedom; Pervukhin's cult of personality, all-encompassing iteration of the NKVD, and absolute control over every facet of economic life; are now harsh but fair measures.\n\nFor Pervukhin himself, the situation could scarcely be more exciting. In effect, the revolutionary Southern Urals: besieged, impoverished, and ravaged as they are, form a perfect analogy to the Russia of 1917. It is only fair, in turn, that Pervukhin be considered its Lenin."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_IZEKOV_AM_DESC:0 "Sergey Mikhailovich Izvekov was not special. He, like many other priests of the Orthodox faith, fled the Holy Russian Empire after the revelation of Taboritsky's hellish perversion of the church. Izvekov helped those he could, leading them out of the nightmare and into the city of Samara. Things were not much better in the former capital of the ROA, but Izvekov and his companions kept their faith alive. They hid in sewers, basements, and in the forests, praying that the nightmare would end.\n\nAnd end it did with the death of the Blessed Regent. The people of Samara rose up, casting off their chains and sending their oppressors back to Hell. Once the city was freed, a new order was established.\n\nCommunism, fascism, tsarism, the hated Burgundian System, all had led Russia deeper into ruin. No, another way must be found, and so the people of Samara looked to God. It was His kindness that led Izvekov, now Vladyka Pimen, to become the first ruler of the theocratic republic of Samara, earning the love and respect of his people to garner enough votes in the first election.\n\nVladyka Pimen is not a weak man, and knows that Larionov rants and raves from Vyatka. It is only a matter of time before the second Blessed Regent turns his guns on the Christian Republic. When he comes, the people of Samara will be ready with faith and steel, and Vladyka Pimen will lead them."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAY_TALBERG_AM_DESC:0 "In the withering eyes of Nikolai Dmitrievich Talberg, there is only power or death.\n\nFirst a government official under the monarchy and later a devout monarchist professor, Nikolai Talberg expected his final days to be papers and lectures in the halls of the Komi Republican Academy. Everything changed when Talberg gained the favor of Taboritsky. Soon, Talberg became the first elder statesman to support the imperial government, and was handpicked by Taboritsky to lead his corporate council. Under Talberg's leadership, the Imperial Mercantile Consortium grew to become the servile beast of the empire, churning through an ever-growing mass of slaves to build the weaponry of Taboritsky's army.\n\nWith Taboritsky's death, many felt the Consortium should take new management, but Talberg silenced any critics foolish enough to state such ideas openly. Instead, Talberg quietly broke from his obedience to Vyatka. Free of its master, the consortium shifted focus, focusing only on ideals which could bring it further riches. Talberg became the leader of the empire's only grace - its empty wealth.\n\nStill, Talberg knows it will all end soon. Facing increasing bouts of illness, the leader has grown unable to sniff out traitors in the council, leaving dissent to fester underneath him. At times, Talberg fondly remembers times when he had students who believed in him and revered his every word. Today, Talberg wakes each day to a council of dogs, waiting to tear apart his domain at the first sign of weakness. And as Talberg grows older, he is only more certain that that day will come."

The enemy is numerous, better equipped and better trained. The only reason they haven't yet been overrun is their knowledge of the land. The Nenets know this, but their resolve is iron.

Mikhail Petrovich Baganov knows, though he wishes day after day that such knowledge was not his. A former Novosibirsk general, Baganov and a cluster of partisans, refugees, and anyone with legs with which to run, melted into the Altay when the madness that had engulfed Komi engulfed Siberia. In the forests and hills, they fought a desperate battle for survival, praying that the dawn would come. It never did.\n\nBaganov watched as Novosibirsk died; no, as Novosibirsk was murdered. As madmen, zealots, and sycophants tore his former country apart, Baganov wept bitter tears of grief. The Russia he once knew was raped, slaughtered, turned inside out, leaving only an ugly, brutalized exterior of blood and pain. As he and his partisans began to lose all hope and as Baganov considered ending his own life, a single ray of hope shined. Taboritsky, the Monster of Syktyvkar, was dead.\n\nAs the Holy Russian Empire began to collapse, Baganov seized his opportunity, his rag-tag army taking back his beloved Novosibirsk. In this new, old city, Baganov proclaims the death of Russia and the birth of a Eurasia free from the agony and hatred of past regimes. A new nation will live on, if it can only survive until dawn."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_ABRAMOV_AM_DESC:0 "Armageddon itself may have come to Russia, but that does not necessarily mean that one can no longer make a tidy profit. Enter Nikolai Ivanovich Abramov, a former associate of Konstantin Rodzaevsky's Russian Fascist Party who has always had a keen eye for opportunities; be they to increase his influence or to line his pockets.\n\nAfter the Russian Far East fell to the dark behemoth to the West, Abramov was one of the lucky few who were able to evade the gaze of Taboritsky's security forces. The RFP's naval wing, of which Abramov was an admiral, was never the most prestigious branch of the organization, and perhaps it was this fact that saved his life in the end. The good fortune would not stop there, though, as soon Taboritsky's regime would crumble with his apparent death, leaving Abramov in a key position to climb the ladder once again.\n\nWith the help of old contacts all across Amur, Abramov was able to carve out a slice of his own in the midst of the apocalypse, and he now finds himself in control of one of the only functional ports still left standing in Russia. Now that the dust has settled, he has offered all sorts of premium services for the privileged few who remain alive; be it safe passage away from the madness that has befallen Russia, or luxury goods from across the world.\n\nNot that he cares too deeply about Russia's plight, of course. Nikolai Abramov saw a chance to get rich, and he took it. "

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_ARTAMONOV_AM_DESC:0 "Nikolai Fedorovich Artamonov was once an unassuming man in a rather underappreciated branch of the Soviet military. Now, however, he may just be the last hope for the people of Kamchatka.\n\nAlthough he did not achieve much acclaim under the rule of Admiral Yumashev, he received some minor political influence when the forces of Alexander Men overran the ports of Kamchatka. He was seen as the most competent man available to manage the local ports, and was given a comfy and relatively well-paid job to administer them in the name of the Divine Mandate. The good times would not last forever, though, as soon a great and terrible storm would blow in from the West.\n\nThe unprecedented scale of the atrocities committed by Sergei Taboritsky's armies served as a sobering reminder to Artamanov that this was a time of action, and to rest on his laurels would be an almost criminal breach of his responsibilities to the people of Kamchatka. With the aid of like-minded local leaders, Artamanov rallied what few remained into a statelet devoted towards a singular goal: the safety and security of Russia's survivors no matter what the cost. Desperate times call for unorthodox solutions, and Artamanov sees only one path forward: the immediate secession of Kamchatka from the state formerly known as Russia, and the admission of the region as a territory of the United States.\n\nSome say that this goal is laughable; a completely impractical solution thought up by a silly man. Artamanov sees no other option. In his eyes, every other avenue has failed, and only that shining city on a hill beyond the Bering Strait could possibly save Russia from total annihilation now."

 POLITICS_JOINT_COUNCIL_AM_DESC:0 "Even after nearly half a millennium spent under Russian domination, the peoples of the steppe have endured. Chauvinistic policies imposed upon them by the tsars of old did not manage to break their spirit, nor did the socially collectivistic nature of the Soviet Union wash away their sacred identity. The Tatars, Bashkirs, and so many other minority peoples began to believe that no matter who their masters were, their cultures would survive.\n\nThen came Sergei Taboritsky.\n\nWielding a capacity for cruelty that even the most belligerent of Russian autocrats would consider a bridge too far, Taboritsky and his dreaded Shturmoviki came down upon the minority cultures dotted across Russia's landscape like a ton of bricks, systematically wiping out communities with reckless abandon. As the Regent's dark grip upon the nation continued to tighten, it seemed as though the steppe peoples were, after so many years of proud existence, facing total extinction. Then, as though by divine intervention itself, Taboritsky was consumed by the dark abyss that he himself had created, and his regime followed.\n\nWith a chance to catch their breath, the minority communities of the steppe decided now was the time to come together for mutual defense, before the scourge to the north had another chance to finish their bloodthirsty mission. What resulted was the Joint Council, an administrative body for the so-called Idel-Ural Free State. With two representatives from each constituent republic, Tatar, Bashkir and Udmurt, as well as three to represent the people as a whole, the Council provides a level of representation that these besieged peoples have not experienced for some time.\n\nWhether or not they can preserve what remains of the sons and daughters of the steppe, however, remains to be seen..."

After seizing an imperial arsenal, they'd brought dynamite to the governor's palace, not bothering to clean the corpses of the soldiers who had died defending this...nightmare. Baganov surveyed the dynamite as it was placed, making sure to step over the pile of gore that had once been the governor. Ripped limb from limb, he remembered the screams. The bastard deserved worse, he thought. They all did. In a lapse of anger he kicked the mangled head of the governor across the hallway. He calmed down immediately, looking around at soldiers wondering what had happened, swiftly returning to their work. He'd have to be calm, but how could he be calm? Here, in this swastika-adorned Hell, a double-headed eagle glaring down on him?\n\nAs he was satisfied with the explosive placement, he shouted for the soldiers to leave. Once they had, they were met by a crowd of shivering, starving survivors, waiting to see what was left of the palace - those parts they hadn't looted - blown to kingdom come. "Do it," Baganov ordered as a soldier pushed the plunger. An explosion rocked the palace, bringing part of it crashing down as pieces of marble and wood flew into the sky, but the main structure remained intact. He sighed, watching the dust settle on the husk of the palace. That damned palace. Its blind eagles staring into a nightmare.\n\nPickaxes, axes, and torches were distributed to the crowd once more descending on the palace. The palace still stood and it must be torn down. The legacy of that madman, that arch-traitor, that Antichrist, had to be destroyed. He and so many others swung, cut, and burned, trying to demolish the gilded symbol of Russia's end, tearing it down brick by sordid, swastika-emblazoned brick. "Fall, damn you, fall!" Baganov muttered as he tore a stairwell to pieces. "What will it take to destroy you?""

With the breakdown of the power grid, only those buildings with generators could still provide heating. He didn't know how many had already frozen to death, how many would in the coming months.\n\nHis mind snapped back into focus as he faced the three Narodniks. "Mr. President, are you alright?" one asked.\n\n"Hmm? Yes, I was just thinking of something. Please continue, Mr. Ivanov."\n\n"The peasantry requires additional aid. With the destruction of Novosibirsk's factories in the past decades, we Narodniks represent the common people of the republic. You can go on about creating a Eurasian utopia all you want, but unless you can help the people you claim to support, your words mean nothing."\n\nBaganov grimaced. "I assure you, sir, we are providing what we can. Supplies are low enough as it is, and we need everything we can to-"\n\n"Aren't you supposed to be helping the people?" the ruddy-faced woman interrupted. "Isn't that the point of your Interim Government? Mr. President, if you cannot promise us food and land, then give us democracy."\n\nBaganov stood up. "I am doing everything I can. Do you know how many corpses I've seen? How many burned villages and desolated farms? The poisoned rivers? That's what being president means. And so long as our people are starving, so long as Taboritsky's remnants haunt the forests, none of us will be safe from death. That's the harsh truth. You want to help the people?

The Imperial Army had used the original town for artillery practice, leaving only ruins for the survivors. Most fled or died, but gradually a settlement formed. The old Red Army combat engineer remembered his orders from Novosibirsk: to try fixing the agricultural situation here.\n\n"So, Captain Emekova," he asked as he dismounted the cart and fetched his supplies, "How are you enjoying your first day as an army engineer?"\n\n"Funnily enough, not as grim as my civilian career," the younger woman replied. "The company's better, you bathe more than those partisans."\n\nHe chuckled, and the two made their way to the gates of Barnaul, greeted by a party of farmers. The two made their way inside as their soldier escorts began distributing the rations they had brought as best they could. Yevgeniy began examining the irrigation structures the farmers had built as Kira examined the soil. Could be constructed better, he supposed, but it wasn't the main issue. He began taking notes as Kira approached. "The water's contaminated, but not by much. Still, it's enough to make most agriculture here difficult."\n\nYevgeniy checked the map he'd brought and pointed west. "The old warlord that used to be based here began working on a water treatment plant about three kilometers that way. Never completed, but we can salvage something, improvise a purifier for the farms here. Better than nothing." He slapped Kira's back as the two mounted their cart and began their salvage."

The Siberian winter and collapse of agricultural supply had taken its toll on the city, and President Baganov had ordered the army to begin cleaning up the bodies of those who had succumbed.\n\nThe homeless population was found slumped, frozen, in alleys and in ruined shops. She'd then had to go into homes to find those who'd frozen to death in their own beds, or taken a more merciful way out first. God help her if the dogs had gotten there first...\n\nAs she drank from her battered flask of vodka, she looked up at the ruined building in front of her. Above the doorway she made out the outline of three gears, a familiar symbol, but one she could not place. She stood up and found a placard covered in the snow. She picked it up, dusting off the snow, and made out a faded word on the battered placard: "Progress."\n\nShe remembered it all at once; the Titan Corporation. The brains of the federation, the nerve center of the Falcon's attempt to forge his new Russia. She scoffed. In a past life, she had been a Narodnik, one of those who kept the promise of a Russia that worked for all the people alive. Titan, Sibir, Feniks, all their supporters, what did they know of "progress?" What had their progress done for the people?\n\nBut in spite of everything, she felt...sorrow? Did she miss them? Yes, she concluded. They were bastards to a man, but they believed in progress, in a strong Russia, in a land where at the very least slaves wouldn't be forced into backbreaking shifts for the glory of a dead princeling, or where she wouldn't have to throw frozen corpses onto pyres because they couldn't dig enough graves. She sighed and took another swig. Titan's progress had lost, to the madness of what used to be Russia. She threw the placard to the side as she returned to work."

"Sounds like a dream. Now shut up and help me, there's got to be a good plane here somewhere."\n\nThe airplane graveyard outside Novosibirsk stretched around them. Most of them were old fighter planes from the war their parents had fought against the Germans, and were at best incapable of flying beyond either Lake Baikal or the Urals. They searched through plane after plane, careful to try and avoid those with the imperial eagle and swastika upon them. They had seen those fly over the skies countless times, bearing gas bombs to some unfortunate village. Even if they were sure they wouldn't trigger the chemical weapons inside, those planes were only capable of slightly longer flights than the fighters. They were made for terror, not travel.\n\nBut almost a full day of searching, salvaging, praying, revealed the horrible truth; those cursed engines of death were the best they had.

They were killed brutally, torn to shreds, their blood painting the walls.\n\nThe masses rose as one. A mass movement's character is that of the average of its people, shared sentiments coalescing into one single fist. It is usually a fist of hope, a great leap towards something better, and that yet remained, for anarchism is but a deeply human sentiment, being that of freedom, and humans were they yet.\n\nBut in the wake of the Regent, who embroiled Russia in the Nightmare, humanity began to resemble the Nightmare. The average had changed, a dark drop of corruption had fell in the pool of human sentiment, and that mass fist became one, perhaps not if of malice, of pain.\n\nWeapons sprung from the floorboards, having been waiting for the Day of Freedom. Bullets sprang through the streets, and the imperials were gunned down, then gunned down more, and, for good measure, filled with more rounds. Were it not for that the fact that they had already been twisted down to the soul, the bodies would have been unrecognizable.\n\nThe trees rang with cries and screams, but not many cheers. Murder, mayhem, and blood, as anarchism and anarchy merged. A black flag was raised, a massive one made of the the cloaks of fallen soldiers, stained in blood, shadowing the garrison. Below it, was the head of the governor, or what was left of it."

A mixture of bastards to the bone and innocents swung from ropes.\n\nYevgeniya Taratuta was smoking. She used to not smoke, but the prohibitions under the empire made her miss the little ways one could kill themself. She looked through the smoke, at a local man responsible for a great deal of the executions, those of collaborators, and those of falsely accused collaborators.\n\n"You know why I have to wear an eyepatch, Taratuta?" he said, his stone facial expressions barely moving.\n\n"I'm sure it has to do with the Regent."\n\nHe chuckled. "That question was less rhetorical than you thought. I don't remember. Working in the factory, after the Regent died, the pains grew to my entire body.

There was a time when he dreaded looking at a full field, knowing that most of it would go to the garrison, the Mad Regent. But now he looked and knew he was free, and knew his family was free. He saw heads poking between tall wheat stalks, some dancing, some just working. It belonged to them all, he had learned. The owner was a general, who was now a head on a stick, and the documents were burnt along with most other remnants of government. Now the earth belonged to men, not the dead, and not the cruel.\n\nA woman was speaking on a tall podium, grasping a book to her chest, taking breaks between words to draw from a long cigar. "Workers!" she said, in a loud yet mellow voice taught restraint by the dark times. "The state has been killed! The Regent has been killed! All that is left is humanity, and human spirits!"\n\nVasily smiled. Damn right! He can farm in peace, as he wanted.\n\n"Now I ask you, the workers, to join us in the first conference! We shall decide for ourselves the direction of us, of Russia!"\n\nNow that, Vasily was less enthused about. Meetings were government, and government was a bullet.

The Black Army sounded good from what he had heard, and he didn't even know where Orsk was. His sack was full, so it was time to go back to the mill.\n\nWhat sounded of thunder woke Vasily from his nap. It was a shame, he thought; it'd been so long since he had been able to slack off. Being free of a boss was nice, he thought, but something horrible interrupted his thoughts. Anna, the girl he fancied, was face down, and he could hear her crying.

The air was silent, broken only by the sound of horses and quiet sobs as the small group of captives stood shivering and silent, awaiting their fate.\n\nThey were once part of the imperial regime. Portly bureaucrats, priests in tattered robes, soldiers with faded patches of the Holy Russian Empire, and even the wife of one of the Mad Regent's governors. People who had enabled the tyranny of a madman. Now there was no Regent to protect them. Now there was only judgement. Only justice.\n\nFrom atop his steed, Androniy Mishurenko motioned, and two of the Black Army soldiers cut the captives free. They stood there, frozen. Mishurenko met the eyes of one of the captives, a women. He smiled coldly. "Run." She remained frozen. Another gesture, and a gunshot sounded, and one of the captives fell dead. That spurred the remaining ones into action, even starved and beaten as they were, their pain was forgotten as adrenaline and terror filled them.\n\nThe soldiers mounted their steeds, chuckling in amusement and jeering at the fleeing captives, watching them scurry like rats in a desperate bid to save their lives. A mere execution for these imperials was too clean. They deserved worse. They deserved to feel a fraction of the fear they had inspired in the name of their Regent. They deserved to suffer, as Russia had. Their last moments would be ones of abject terror, of pain, of suffering as the Black Army extracted justice long overdue.\n\nThe charade had lasted long enough. Putting two fingers to his lips, he whistled, and the soldiers cheered and kicked their horses into action and their bloodlust took over. As Mishurenko led the charge, he savored the terror of the imperials, moments before they were trampled under the steeds of the reborn Black Army."

More brawls and fighting rings were springing up, a particularly large one between two of the few women who remained with the true Black Army.\n\nAs Mishurenko walked through the manor, he shook his head at the men knocked out on the floor or slumped against the wall. Poorly fared the man in this place who could not hold his drink or fists well. Ah well, such was the freedom the Black Army embodied. No greater was such ideals represented than in this place. Inheritance claimed through conquest, and now rightfully belonged to them.\n\nThis place which had once stood to embody the passive horror of the Mad Regent's bureaucracy now stood ransacked. The fine furniture torn up and stained, smelling of beer. The fancy rugs burned or sold. Portraits of Taboritsky placed in corners where men pissed on them to the cheers of their drunken brethren.\n\nA fitting end for this monument to imperial statism - or something like that. Perhaps this revelry he witnessed was not in the true spirit of anarchism, yet to Mishurenko's mind, only sniveling puritans like Taratuta would look upon this expression of freedom, and condemn it.

The stenographer began:\n\n"To the traitorous bitch-dog known as Taratuta, be prepared to understand your weakness!\n\nWe require no account other than our own eyes, for we have seen a whore rape her nation and claim it peace! We have watched as your cuckolded pawns live in squalor, as you let them wallow in shit and wallow in it yourself! Watch, Taratuta, as a million impure savages lick their lips, as they think of ways to fuck your nation. Without the watchful eye of the Black Army, there is no hope for the good people of Siberia, as they are trapped in a rancid carcass as it swarms with flies.\n\nHave you provided freedom and prosperity to your peasants? No! Those who have turned away from Androniy Mishurenko, the true liberator of the peasants and workers, are now as impoverished and sullen as the common bitch. Those within Mishurenko's vast lands weep, as they watch you fuck their daughters and mothers. How do you not stain your vast, piggish face with tears at the plight of your own nation? So long as you breathe, you are a sore on the ass of every Russian peasant.

Ah, doesn't matter, does it?" Both men found their inside joke more funny than Yuri, who could only stand there in silent fury and fear, as he knew that there was nothing he could do.\n\n"The Black Army appreciates your contribution, companion," the soldier said mockingly, as he grabbed an unopened beer bottle on his way out. "Oh, that is a fine horse you have out front. Don't worry, we'll take good care of her."

True freedom, in a way the previous "Free" Territory had never possessed. The cowards and traitors under Taratuta called him a dictator, yet how could he be a dictator when he had the complete loyalty of his men? Jealousy, that was all it was, they saw the riches his men plundered, the endless stores of food and drink they enjoyed, and they stewed in anger at the sight of the true freedom his Black Army enjoyed. The Black Army, who was returning justice to the Siberian lands one dead imperial at a time - along with anyone else foolish enough to stand in their way.\n\n"Companions!"

For some reason, the memory drifted unwarranted to his mind as Stanisław struggled to fit the undersized crown on his head.\n\n"For God's sake, Michael, an emperor...does not laugh like some peasant!"\n\n"Sorry, man, but you have to see - isn't there something about this that is hilarious?

Is that any word for a royal retainer to say?"\n\nBoth men looked at each other for a second and then began laughing uncontrollably.

People will be gathering outside by now, and the coronation will be only the first step.

Almost all of it had been devised in the spur of the moment - including the extreme religiosity. Ironic, coming from a communist and atheist, though neither of these things seemed to matter very much.

Like after dealing with a rat infestation, one still flinches at every sound from behind the walls or beneath the floorboards.\n\nAnd yet there was another parasitic infestation to deal with.\n\n"Men, followers of the tsar, keepers of Holy Russia!" his voice boomed through the hall, staring over the small throng of officers and bureaucrats watching him.

At first, the targets seemed obvious; rivals for regional power, pragmatic collaborators who lacked ideological loyalty, suspected crypto-Jews, and the like. Then they started grabbing others, those who as far as anybody knew had done nothing wrong or disloyal. One stood up and proclaimed "God save Alexei, the tsar who shall be, and God bless his holy regent!" Others joined in, alternating between "Praise Alexei!" and "Praise Dikiy!" but it was futile at stopping some of them from being dragged away. Even some of the Shturmoviki were suddenly arrested by their comrades.\n\nWhen it was all over, the numbers of the audience had been reduced by about half, and the remainder were giving a fervent standing ovation to Dikiy-almost as if their lives depended on it."

When they came back down, it was clear what they had done: they affixed a swastika to the back of the cross! And while the welders worked on top of the church, a similar commotion happened just outside the front door.\n\n"You cannot do this!" cried Father Nikodim, "you would not dare burn images of Apostles and prophets!"\n\n"We are not burning images of Apostles and prophets," replied a Shturmovik, "we are burning images of Paul the Jew and Moses the Jew. Tell me, Father, are you a Rabbi?"\n\n"N-no," the old man stuttered.\n\n"Is this a synagogue?"\n\n"What does this-"\n\n"Then you should not be keeping images of Jews in your church!"

Dikiy could see the light glinting off the polished helmets of the Shturmoviki, as well as the tips of their bayonets. They charged forward out of their foxholes and bunkers in the night, toward the village that the damnable Asiatic Buryats had turned into a bulwark of resistance.\n\nGunfire started coming from the village, and some of the Shturmoviki fell, but the rest weren't deterred. THey charged with no less valor than before, rifles held firmly, screaming war cries in the name of the tsar and regent. For a moment, Dikiy forgot that the empire had fallen, and he was watching them crush rebels in the first Regent's eastward march all over again.\n\nAt last, the Shturmoviki reached the village, and they began cutting a bloody swathe through it.

Not when Holy Russia is in such shape. If it were the Polack pretender across the river making a mockery of Alexei's name, it would have been enough. But the financial situation was looking increasingly dire as well. Man cannot live on bread alone, but an army cannot march on prayers to God alone either.\n\nHe took off his glasses and polished them before looking at the river again, as if it could somehow deliver a greater tranquility now that his vision was cleared. Nothing. Suddenly, Dikiy felt incredibly faint, and he staggered toward the armchair in the office's corner before he passed out completely. He felt his glasses slip off his nose, and he vaguely heard a crunch beneath his feet as he flopped into the chair. He would worry about his glasses when he was conscious again."

How long was it since he had been outside, two days? Judging by the pile of plates in the corner of his office, it was probably closer to three. Of course, as far as his men were concerned, he was valiantly conducting affairs of state and solving the problems that plague the regency. But frankly, it was getting hard to tell the difference between the problems and the state. Who was his friend anymore? Who was his enemy? Were his guards up to something? Why did demanding more guard rotations not solve that? Was the officer who planned the guard rotations in on it? What was he in on?\n\nDikiy glanced at the wall, showing a map of Russia, endless lines drawn on it in half a dozen colors showing the ever-shifting borders of the state. That was it! With Russia so divided, he could simply wage wars and keep the guards he distrusted on the front lines at all times! It was genius, why didn't he think of that before?\n\nHe returned to his desk and began feverishly writing, composing battle strategies, drafting mobilization orders, all the the energy of a man possessed. Possessed by a divine will to powergranted through the intercession of the Tsarevich, no doubt."

They had promised all kinds of supplies and valuable goods to aid his efforts, so it was only natural that when he had met with these so-called friends of his, they claimed that the deliveries were held up by red tape and various other bureaucratic inconveniences.\n\nUndeterred, Sobchak wasted no time making a beeline for the coast to discuss terms with a wealthy American who claimed to be interested in lending a hand. The meeting did not go well. The American had neglected to mention beforehand that he wanted cold, hard cash in exchange for his help; cash that Sobchak did not have.\n\nAfter some vague promises were made, a deflated Sobchak then looped back to the ruins of Zeya to inspect one of the last remaining armaments industries still in operation. "In operation" turned out to be a generous way of putting it indeed, as the factory had a shortage of workers, working equipment, and electricity. It seemed his militia would have to go even further without even the bare minimum of equipment.\n\nA long day had passed, and Sobchak was not sure he had accomplished anything at all. As he crawled into bed that cold and lonely night, dark thoughts began to creep into places once occupied by cautious optimism. He had returned to Russia to save as many lives as he could, but Sobchak was slowly becoming aware that he may have underestimated the challenges involved. Did the rest of the world even care what was happening here? Today, he may have just received the answer to that question."

It wasn't too long ago that he was caught up in the whirlwind of the resurgent White movement centered in Chita, with the illegitimate Romanov prince Mikhail Andreevich as its nucleus. Sobchak didn't know what had become of Mikhail after they had fled Russia, but he had assumed that this time the former tsar had given up on Russia for good.\n\nSobchak folded the letter and stashed it in his coat pocket, focusing his attention to the tons of Australian grain being hauled off a ship for transport. If not from Mikhail himself, someone sympathetic to his cause certainly still had a vested interest in Russia. After spending so much time scraping by in hostile territory, Sobchak found it reassuring that he still had some friends out there.\n\nWith the situation deteriorating by the day, he could only hope it would be enough."

As he approached the scene, he was greeted by a rather familiar elderly officer. "Anatoly Aleksandrovich, I appreciate you coming here on such short notice."\n\n"It's no trouble at all, Nikolay." Sobchak looked over Kossov's shoulder to see a group of foreigners being aggressively questioned by his guards. "What am I looking at here, exactly? Who are these men?"\n\nKossov glanced at the scene behind him before turning back to Sobchak. "We caught these Japanese fellows trying to sneak in by boat. They claim to be here on a humanitarian mission, but my men think they might be here for a different reason."\n\nSobchak sighed. "Tell your men to let them go. Japan has no reason to be spying on us, they've got bigger fish to fry than some naive fools in the middle of Siberia."\n\n"Are you certain, Anatoly? I've spent enough time down south to know that Japan never extends their hand for free. You wish to take that risk?"\n\n"For Christ's sake, Nikolay, let them go. Have you forgotten we're still standing waist-deep in shit? I'm not about to turn away help on the off chance there might be strings attached. Do you even know if they're here on behalf of Japan at all?"\n\nKossov nodded without another word, and with a call to his men, the aid workers were allowed to continue their mission; as Sobchak had guessed, it was apparently one of genuine altruism, rather than the quid-pro-quo they were suspected of."

It seemed that if there was anything at all that once called this place home, it had either been looted or sent to a shallow grave. Fighting through a trifecta of freezing temperatures, horrid smells, and poisonous air, Sergey made his way to the center of the dig site where the rest of his comrades had regrouped.\n\n"Sergey!" His superior called out as he approached. He could barely recognize him under all the NBC gear, and Sergey wondered how it wasn't the same story vice-versa. "I think we're just about done here. Go take a look in the tunnels, see if we missed anything. The rest of you, get ready to move out!"\n\nSergey was not enthused about crawling around in a tight space, especially in conditions such as these. He had hoped that the tunnel had collapsed so that he wouldn't have to bother, but as he arrived at his destination, Sergey's hopes were dashed. The mines were clear of any blockages, for the most part, but that was about the only positive thing one could say about their condition.\n\nEven with his flashlight in hand, the tunnels were darker than any place Sergey had ever been, and naturally, they seemed completely barren of any useful minerals. After what seemed like hours of crawling around in the dark, Sergey sighed as he turned to leave, his weary voice echoing off the rocky walls.

The question was not entirely unfamiliar to Artyom, of course, for he had once asked the same thing of his own father nearly fifty years ago.\n\nThe year was 1921, and the Bolsheviks were in the ascendant. Artyom, a child at the time, was forced to flee his homeland towards safer shores. His days spent in Russia at the time had been nothing if not pleasant, safely growing up in the lap of luxury thanks to his family's wealth. Of course, it was this wealth that had painted a giant crosshair over each and every member of the Valentinov clan, necessitating their escape from the only home they ever knew.\n\nHis father's answer, of course, was yes. After many years spent hiding away in Canada, his promise came true nearly three decades later: when the White Army emerged from hibernation in Harbin to carry on the old fight once again. The Valentinovs would be among the first to return to Russia to aid them however they could.\n\nWhen they had first arrived, they had numbered over a dozen: including Artyom, his wife, and his four sons. Now, only two of this illustrious clan remained; slowly whittled away by the horrors that would blow in from the West like a terrible storm. When Artyom had left Russia, he did so with a homesickness in his heart, but he knew that it was an entirely different story with his son. He had survived, but not without bearing witness to the very worst that humankind had to offer.\n\n"Father?" His son's voice brought him back to the present.

 # Free Port Of Magadan Flavour Events #

 after_midnight.51.d:0 "Turbulent waves of seawater crashed upon the rugged and precipitous rocks of the shore, seeping into the small, porous holes present within the sides of the old wharves and docks, protruding into the tempestuous open waters of the Sea of Okhotsk.\n\nNikolai Abramov observed the everyday nature of the port from within a modest office, overlooking a remarkable jewel of the Siberian coast: Magadan, humbled only in the Far East by Vladivostok itself. Abramov sat himself down before an aged wooden desk, littered with nautical maps and shipping records, clasping his hands together as he reviewed them with attentiveness. He had once pledged his skills and seamanship to the cause of the Russian Fascist Party, sailing under the banners of national socialism and the swastika. What naive fools they were, relentlessly pursuing empty ideological principles and dogma set in place by distant and bygone men, blinding them from their necessary duties; the two separate branches claimed to be different, yet Abramov held no loyalty to either.\n\nReminiscing about the past is pointless now, he thought. The Russian Fascist Party had ceased to exist long ago, their actions and deeds relegated to the annals of history, but he was still here. Abramov fixed his mind upon present matters; opening a drawer, he placed a map of the region squarely in front of himself, marked with common shipping routes. As he observed the map, he began theorizing about overlooked portions of the ocean where his smuggled cargo could slip past unnoticed from the prying eyes of foreign patrol ships, and which routes would net the most substantial profits.\n\nA series of vessels departed from Magadan's shores, brimming with illicit goods, bound for locations across the seas. Regardless of where they are headed, they will all return to the same place: the port nestled upon the frigid coastline of the Far East."

A ship could be seen in the distance, its hull adorned with a stripe of dark crimson; despite the fact that dozens of vessels of the same size pass by the icy port to participate in its clandestine operations every day, this ship, in particular, attracted the fixated attention of crowds of sailors and dock workers. Once the ship was in port, the reason for its allure was quickly revealed as the crew unloaded crate after crate of sweet and fragrant alcohol.\n\nTo Nikolai Abramov, the appeal of indulging in alcoholic beverages is something he was all too familiar with. It was a craving that needed to be satiated once in a while, and it brought forth the ecstasy and bliss of temporarily losing awareness of one's abundance of problems and responsibilities; in the current desperate state of affairs, the elevated demand was self-explanatory.\n\nAn abundance of vodka and gin in Magadan itself would certainly be of benefit, Abramov thought. He was aware of the lucrative financial prospects it could bring to the territory, as alcohol was desired in markets all around the world. A single yet crucial issue, however, existed: the acquisition of such goods would prove to be a substantial challenge, as shipping routes for alcohol did not usually cross into the waters of the Sea of Okhotsk. As Abramov continued to deliberate, a thought popped into his mind: piracy. Although he did not have the adequate manpower or equipment necessary for direct involvement, he possessed valuable contacts in the South China Sea, contacts who would gladly divert Japanese alcohol shipments to the north, for a price.\n\nAbramov smiled as he reached for the half-empty bottle of vodka beside his desk, a rarity soon to be plentiful in the frozen northern port."

In the distance, the distinctive shape of a vessel could be seen from the coastline, drifting slowly towards the horizon.\n\nThe unremarkable ship, though nominally transporting a shipment of coal, ferried dozens of men, women, and children; people who wished to begin anew in shores of greater opportunity and stability, people who wished to abandon their dreadful livelihoods in the derelict remnants of a land once called Russia. The atmosphere aboard the ship was one of euphoria and exhilaration; the open decks were brimming with elated men, bottles of vodka in hand, celebrating their progression into a future of hope and optimism. The vivacious and ebullient cheers of ecstasy were interrupted as a deafening crash could be heard from the decks below, the vessel began to tilt gradually as a deluge of frigid seawater poured into the hull with the force of a tempestuous maelstrom, slowly weighing down what had become an iron sarcophagus. The enthusiastic and merry atmosphere of the passengers had dissipated, replaced with expressions of horror and cries of fear as the tumultuous ocean slowly devoured part after part of the ship, forcing the people aboard to resort to increasingly futile attempts at survival, unwilling to accept fate.\n\nNikolai Abramov watched from a distance, his facial expression was one of indifference, having no remorse over what he considered was just. The ship had refused to pay the full amount required for docking and had exited the port, there had to be measures of retaliation, for they must set a clear precedent. Three red flares shot up into the evening sky, a last, desperate plea for rescue; a plea that would never be answered."

He sighed in exasperation as grim thoughts of distress flooded his mind, overwhelming him with dread as he remembered the dire straits they were currently in. He calmed himself down with the last tool still present within his mental arsenal: hope. Hope that the future would not be as forlorn as today; hope that he may return one day to a recovered and united homeland; hope that even as the ships he possessed were paltry in comparison to the mighty vessels of decades past, he would still be able to sail towards the horizon in triumph, smiling with glee.\n\nThe deafening sound of a ship's horn scattered Leonid's thoughts and pulled him back into reality. One of his men pointed towards a strange, foreign ship approaching the modest flotilla. The words "Free Marine Infantry" were inscribed onto the side of the ship, confusing Leonid as the men made contact. Soon, a small party appeared before Leonid and began reciting demands in an emotionless tone, calling for him to surrender his ship. Leonid was taken aback by the bluntness of their words, but knew that he was not in a position to negotiate as made evident by the weapons being brandished by several of the men. He deliberated for a short while before deciding to flatly decline; he had sacrificed too much and toiled for too long to simply abandon everything.

As he let out a sigh of fatigue and began pulling, he failed to notice the approaching ship; a vessel slightly larger and bulkier than his own, commandeered by men dressed in drab, threadbare woolen uniforms. Before a single word of protest could be uttered, one of the men jumped onto the boat and proceeded to ferociously pummel the fisherman with exceeding force using a rubber cudgel before dragging him, blood-soaked, aboard. The man's ship was seized and taken to the hub of illicit activity that was Magadan, to be sold for a pretty penny at the smuggling market.\n\nAbramov sat squarely before his desk as he sifted through various reports from differing regions and times; sightings of sizable ships with hefty steel hulls, bearing the colors of Manchukuo, armed with imposing guns of different calibers. He slammed his fist onto the wooden table as he continued to contemplate his options; would the self-indulgent Japanese lords to the south truly bother with such trivial affairs as the deprivation of a handful of Chinese fishermen, to the point where they would expend resources to infringe upon sovereign waters? As thoughts raced across his mind, he readjusted his thinking; regardless of whether the specific reports were factual, it certainly would be reasonable to suggest Japanese interference in the Sea of Okhotsk, and as long as there is a slim possibility, his craft would be at stake.\n\nAbramov peered out towards the docks and harbors below, brimming with workers loading and unloading crates upon crates of smuggled cargo; then towards the vast and boundless ocean, stretching for uncountable miles, extending into the horizon.

In a clumsy first attempt to find a harbour along the coast of Eastern Kamchatka capable of taking them in, this American vessel had nearly run aground several times, sending the sailors closer and closer to panic and possible mutiny each time, the captain becoming the target of silent frustration. At last, the tensions dissipated as the brilliant light of a lighthouse - clearly makeshift, but serviceable enough and certainly a sight for sore eyes - guided them to the destination they had been searching for. Awaiting them was a large, but crude harbour, likely built recently for the specific purpose of receiving aid, such as that carried by the American ship. As they pulled into that harbour, a crowd of Russians, looking largely malnourished but no less jubilant for it, cheered for them. "Come on John, let's not keep them waiting." One sailor called out to another, as the ship anchored.

She was an old model, a transport ship from some forgotten convoy, bruised from 20 years of hard work and rusted from 30 years of abandonment in a Far Eastern harbor. Her floorboards cracked with every malicious crash of a wave against her hull, and new leaks let loose their payload of freezing water at the cue of the metallic, screeching sounds of plating tearing.\n\nThe wind howled, laced with razorblade sleet, around the Captain's reddening and frostbitten ears as he shouted orders over the roaring of the tides and the deathrattle of his craft. It was too late, of course, but Ivan was never a man to give up on his word - he was going to bring him, his family, and the rest of the refugees to Alaska or die in the heart of the sea. Dying at sea was a blessing compared to what would be in store for them back home.\n\nWith another roar of splitting steel, the ship began to sink rapidly. Ice cold water was lapping its way over the deck, and the crew and passengers atop it were already beginning to tumble into the frothing mouth of the arctic off the steepening slope of the deck. The ones below...Ivan chose not to think about what had happened to them. Taking in one last shaky breath, he put on a stiff upper lip, and allowed himself to keep the latter half of his promise. The St. Niphon was dragged under, and at last her cries of pain ended along with her crew's.\n\nThe Orthodox graveyard outside of Anchorage was grimly silent under the cold sun. It was empty but for a priest and a single journalist. Four blank gravestones marked the final resting place of the sailors who had been found.

With quality firewood increasingly scarce and highly priced after everything that had happened to the Russian landscape, coal had become truly invaluable as a cheap and relatively widely available heat source to the ordinary people of Kamchatka, and of what remained of Russia in general.\n\nThe sailors, as friendly as ever, even helped to unload the cargo themselves to lighten the load of the local people, despite the difficulty of communication between the two groups; in times like these, they reasoned, help should not have to be asked for to be received.

One could just close their eyes shut and let themselves be swallowed by the sea of sounds and visuals that shaped this kingdom of liberty, this haven of humanity - and Artamonov would do just that.\n\nAs the world around him went dark with his shut lids, Nikolai could hear the Siren's song purring into his eardrums, the beeping of cars and the clamors of passerby serving as the symphony to which she seduced this battered soul to stay and remain in its urban paradise. He could feel the city's ethereal arms wrapping upon his heart coated with ice, melting away its casing as to let it beat free from the terror that besieged it in Russia. He would no longer need to worry of the horrors that lurked east, it murmured; he would not even worry of missing any food to eat or people to see. A home that awaited him with great arms.\n\nNikolai could smile to the sweet words and mellow promises, yet home was not what his spirit sought most.

Taboritsky's only request, a metal sculpture of Tsar Alexei, was slowly being dismantled by construction crew as twelve limousines slipped through the gates and entered the monolith.\n\nIn the first hours of morning, a cabal of the regency's industrial leaders entered Meeting Room 25 in the top floor of the Kostroma office, flanked by a pair of guards and several emaciated servants.

Those men, the so-called thinkers of the boardroom, always balked at the Consortium. When they saw the pictures of the massive cathedrals, smeared with filth and packed with broken beings, they were afraid.

Nikolay was certain they were laughing at him. He knew why they'd even attempt to make a deal, and it wasn't out of German kindness. It was violence. They were younger than him. Stronger than him. Bloodhounds on the hunt, ready to rip out his neck and bring the corpse to German masters.\n\nFinally, one spoke in broken Russian - "This.. good wine. May we see?"

With every day spent waiting for change, Russia's will decayed, its spirit abolished in favor of heresy. Such was the fate of the people of Samara - victims to apathy, soldiers of sloth. Russian spirit was born anew, and in a sense, it repeated. When clergymen gave sermons to their people, the people listened - the word of the Lord had returned to Russia, expunged too long by insanity.

Poor manufacturing skills, the cost of half your skilled workers being turned to brick-layers or corpses. The image of the uprising flashed to Fredrik's mind, prompting him to take out his match box.\n\nThat was better. Now, he could really think. Right; the problem was a total lack of infrastructure for essentials, and everyone was starving from their side of the Don to Nizhny Novgorod. If only everyone knew just how bad things were in this goddamned city. The tobacco and tea had mixed together into a vomit-inducing smell, certainly not helped by the figures sitting on the paper behind Fredrick, as he sat in front of his desk, and watched the smoke dissipate as the ceiling fan chopped it to pieces. This wasn't enough. Walking out the door, he left it open, half to air out the diseased waste bin, half to show his superiors he hadn't been sleeping, as if the smell wasn't enough an indicator. Stepping outside, the streets of Samara weren't actually crowded, not by his definition, but the signs of a city fit for starvation were everywhere. He let out a puff of smoke and stepped down from his office steps with an irrelevant urgency, as the reports he'd left unfinished in his office would need much more than the seconds he'd saved. As he walked, he checked his surroundings. He walked past a couple, thin as his pencils, and half as strong. They looked at him as he passed, half expecting themselves to be shot by him. "The Russian look", they called it. The figures showed there would be another few thousand in Samara by tomorrow."

Vladimir Bayersky, the last ROA general, half-asleep, gestured to the paper script in front of the both of them. The hall the meeting was taking place in was a relic of Taboritsky's exploits, redecorated to abolish the vile memories of the unspeakably horrific character. The mural to the Tsarevich, a symbol of the horrific actions taken in his name, was repainted with the dull yellows and reds into a scene of the heavens, though with the scheme adorning the wall, it was hard to associate the scene with anything but the land below their feet. The swastikas hanging from the walls were burnt, and candles were lit in the name of a new age. The grandmaster looked to his surrounding accomplices. A half-dozen civilian governors, the general, all standing around each other in equal stoic hope and total impatience. This little ceremony was a luxury they could hardly afford, and yet here they were, standing around the republic's soon-to-be constitution. The right to vote was the first, an obvious pick since authority was established in Samara. The right to pray was, again, inherent. The power to conscript any one citizen into the armed forces was an unpopular decree, but still one many saw as essential.\n\nSo the list went, and by the time the last rights and responsibilities were uttered, all signed the piece of paper along the dotted lines and returned to their duties. How could they not, when crime and homelessness were skyrocketing? The civilians returned to their offices to direct where aid was to go, while General Bayersky returned to his duties of maintaining the fledgling national army. Grandmaster Pimen would not be so sudden to leave. Walking up and down the darkened temple, Pimen pondered whether this constitution would make any kind of a difference. With refugees pouring into Samara, Catholic or not, they'd be proving a deficit upon the nation as a whole. The situation could certainly be fixed with time, though that was something the republic did not have."

Taking a pause to collect himself, Pimen looked to his hands, and put down his pen. Letting out a sigh, he pushed his maroon leather seat away from his beaten, oak table, and looked to the brass knobs of the drawers to his desk, filled with stacks of paper, denoting one piece of information after another. His office was the bureaucratic highway into the future, and Metropolitan Pimen knew just how bleak it looked. All that awaited to complete his understanding of the republic was to review its first census. His door was heaved open, and the metropolitan sighed. Here it was - Pimen could already feel it off of the poor sap handing it over to him. This was the census.\n\nIt was a collection of seven different sheets of paper, the topmost one scarred by a coffee stain. Held together by a flimsy paper clip, it was a miracle the report hadn't fallen apart in his hands. Quickly scanning the front page, he felt a sensation of sweat and grime, probably from the ever-stressed accountants and bean-counters handing things over to someone who knew about as much on where that report was supposed to go as anyone else. Metropolitan Pimen couldn't keep fooling himself. As many details as he tried to make note of, he couldn't erase that feeling in the back of his head that he needed to just read the paper. He refocused his eyes over the ink, and read. What the aides heard was not precisely describable, only really identifiable through what it must be doing to the office therein. Crackling of wood could definitely be made out, as could the splinters creeping from under the door. A wailing was equally audible, if now withering into a subdued whimper. After ten minutes of the charade, the door was finally pushed open by the metropolitan, now looking to be disheveled beyond what any of the young accountants had ever seen in their entire lives. He had tears flowing down his face, and scanned over his flock."

However, the only soldiers in sight were those keeping the jeering crowds back from the spies bound and gagged atop the stage, four nooses staring at them from across the unsteady planks. All four of them had varying severity of gashes along their faces, and ragged clothing was nearly ubiquitous. As closely as they resembled refugees, they were Shturmoviki.\n\nThe criminal on the far left, wearing a dulled scarf and shoddy, thin coat, had his face broken like shattered glass. The thinner, second thug from the left apparently surrendered at the first opportunity and begged all the way to Samara for food. If only he knew how bad things had gotten in this city. The traitor to the middle-right seemed to yell at the hungry man - not that it could be heard over the shouting of the enraged crowds. According to his captors, Pimen had heard the madman wore a combat vest before it was seized from him, leaving him with nothing but his slacks and a green jacket. Judging from the dozen or so guns seized from his apartment, he was ready to take on the entirety of the national army. Finally, the last man seemed as though he'd be dead in a minute anyway. On the stage, he wore a heavy trench coat, and seemed nauseous while staring at his noose, and had the sick complexion of someone about to vomit bile across himself, and judging from his clothes, already had.\n\nAs the guards lifted the degenerate terrorists to their nooses, the jeering from the crowd, the pushing and shoving, grew so intense that it seemed a riot would break out. Then, the stage groaned. And with an uneasy creak, it crashed to the ground. The guards fell over or found themselves trapped beneath the boards. The mob climbed over the wreck and pulled out the bodies of the bloodied thugs. Then, the mob tore them limb from limb. The metropolitan watched and felt an urge to act, to say "This is wrong.""

Yet, difficulty was an odd word when discussing the times that had fallen upon the former lands of Russia. If you couldn't put up with some difficulty after all, you hadn't survived the Mad Regent's reign.\n\n"Comrades." He began, having said the entire speech twice before in Russian and Polish helped him feel in his head for the right Kazakh words to use, though he doubted his grasp of the tongue was about to win any ovations from those listening over the radio.\n\n"It is with great pleasure that I can say the last bastion of the Mad Regent's butchers in these lands have been brought to justice by your revolutionary brethren in the Autonomous Soviet Liberation Army." Kukliński paused for a few moments, the cheers would need to die down before he delivered the full message. "The many peoples of this land have struggled for decades against fascist tyranny, and that struggle is something we shall endeavour to continue to the utmost. Yet I am here not to talk of that struggle just at the moment, I am here to tell you that there is much work to do before that moment will arrive. The day when the red banner of socialism shall fly from Lisbon to Vladivostok awaits us yet. But first, first comrades, we must rebuild our homes. We must bury those lost, and we must create a future for our children."\n\nThe speech continued long after that of course, but those few sentences were what stuck in the minds of the Kazakhs who listened in. Though the Pole's grasp of the language was nominal, something about what he said struck a light of hope in their thoughts. For the first time in years, men and women went to sleep not afraid of what the dark night outside held."

Refugees had poured into the rebuilt town of Zhanakala, burnt to the ground by the Regent's men. But with the ASLA in control now, people felt it safe to return to the urban zones - safe enough that a town once barely holding 5,000 people hosted nearly 12,000 refugees amidst the ruins and the new surrounding tent city. Some were Poles, who'd fled from first the fascists and then been some of the Mad Regent's last targets. Many were Russians, fled from the same but hated by Pole and Kazakh alike for being perceived as getting off lightly. The Kazakhs were smaller in number so far north in the ASLA to begin with, but the Mad Regent's efforts had reduced that number even further.\n\nThe standoff was between representatives of all three: a grizzled Kazakh soldier who Ivan knew led a militia, a one-armed Pole clutching his party membership, and a Russian woman garbed like a nurse with an ancient rifle slung on her shoulder. Ivan didn't need to take more than a glance to know things would end in bloodshed if he didn't intervene.\n\nIt had apparently begun with the Kazakh and the Pole arguing over whose land the town had been built on to begin with, and when the Russian had tried to say it didn't matter, the response from the other two had blamed the actions of Taboritsky on Russian imperialism as a whole. Ivan supposed he should have been surprised by those thoughts, but he'd heard similar enough ones too often from gaunt sunken eyed refugees. He supposed he couldn't blame them for tying the actions of a tyrant to his people.\n\nIn the end though, he was able to disperse the three before anyone was struck. Promising to find some more homes for the injured and elderly amongst those in the tents managed to get their minds of the more petty conflict they'd been engaged in. For Ivan, it was merely another day in life. He knew something else would happen tomorrow, but that was to come. Peace had been maintained for now."

Inwardly, she cursed the Purification men for the thousandth time; the father of her two girls wasn't even Russian! He'd been an Udmurt by ancestry, not that it had mattered to the men who shot him.\n\nA thunderous explosion heralded a handful of converted trucks clattering over the nape of the hill that had allowed the column to escape the initial attack, and to Ayim's horror, there were machine guns mounted above the cabins of each. In her hurry to push her daughters behind the small crate that contained their belongings, Ayim missed the first cries of relief from ahead. But as the sound of the machine guns stopped, she finally looked out of the wagon to see a sight Allah himself couldn't have made any more welcome.\n\nOn either side of the carts ahead of her were advancing figures with red and white patches on their arms, soldiers, but not shooting at her. Horsemen yelled battle cries as they careened into the front ranks of the Purification men, giving enough time for a pair of ancient tankettes to open up with their cannons on the armed trucks.

Well, the priest reflected, as he gazed off to the side where the other half of the village's administration sat on a tattered but still functional prayer mat, not quite the only one.\n\n"You do realise there will be problems if we build either the church or the mosque separately." Imam Rinat grumbled.

Filip offered as a rejoinder. Rinat simply stared at the mixed band of men and women setting up tents by the riverside before shaking his head.\n\n"We need a mill and a place to pray, we don't have enough bricks for three and we can't use mud for a mill. Separate rooms will have to do." The Imam promptly started coughing. Once perhaps Filip might have despaired at that blunt statement of fact, but as he looked at the mix of Poles, Kazakhs and a dozen other peoples from whom the flock before him had once belonged to, working together in the harsh sun, Filip felt it wasn't so insurmountable a goal.\n\n"I think we can manage that."

The rapidly retreating penumbra had left behind several vestiges of their presence, symbols of the abhorrent suffering they had brought upon these lands. To many, they were rallying points for retribution.\n\nA resentful tempest of jagged daggers and deafening gunfire descended upon the Russian Shturmoviki guards of the slave outpost, frightened and stupefied. Unintelligible shouts and cries brimming with rage and indignation accompanied the screams of fear as sharp steel viciously cut into the flesh of petrified Russian guards, tattering their woolen uniforms, covered in fresh stains of crimson. Bursts of white, hazy smoke permeated into the air as Tatar firearms emptied their loads into the backs of fleeing men, the copper-plated bullets lodging themselves within various body parts with infallible precision. Pleads for mercy were met with the distinctive crackles of a pistol, their bodies lifelessly collapsing onto the ground.\n\nAs any semblance of opposition began to dissipate within the camp, the assailants turned their attention towards the liberation of their countrymen, rendered slaves by the Shturmoviki. They were unbound from their shackles and released from their fetters, hundreds upon hundreds returned to their homes alongside their liberators, free men once more.

Taboritsky saw that all of the peoples he deemed "inferior" to his Greater Russians were to be eradicated from the annals of history - his history. The scholar had witnessed himself the cruelty that had been inflicted upon his people's great works and memorable texts, the Shturmoviki proving meticulous in incinerating and shredding all matters of scripture that so much as oozed 'degeneracy'. The smell of burning paper still haunted his senses, even as the cold Ural breeze surged into his lungs as he remained stood before the husk of an old, burned school - the stench of their ignorance, serving as his scar from that ghastly regime.\n\nThankfully, some of the important knowledge had been preserved in his aging mind - but he was just one literate man amid a sea of broken, illiterate souls within the village he called home. Most of his wards barely had an understanding of the basic history of the Tatar, barely adjusted to the general teachings. To make it worse, almost all of his peers were survivors of those horrid death camps, their minds forever hijacked by the ghastly sights they have witnessed within those fenced compounds of misery and agony - it barely left enough space for such younglings to even build the motivation to study.\n\nSlowly, he brought himself to sit down upon the front steps of the school, his shoulders forever burdened with the arduous task of salvaging a history torn to shreds and cast to the winds of fate.

He launched himself forwards and barreled out of the forest at last. The guards guffawed as he staggered to a stop.\n\n"That's forty-five. Looks like he's the last one," the sergeant said as Konstantin climbed into the back of one of the trucks, taking a seat next to the few other soldiers who'd finished ahead of him. The trucks lurched into motion and started pulling away. He heard the gurgling sound of gas shells passing overhead, and the crumping sounds of them impacting behind him. He saw a golden fog start to creep out of the receding trees."

There were twenty-three in total, and behind them over a hundred humanoid mongrels and traitorous deserters had taken shelter from his men. Reconnaissance reported that they had been heavily armed and alert, and would have been a difficult target for the infantry to hit. Luckily, there was no need to send in the troops; the Imperial Guard still had plenty of toys stowed away. It didn't have to spend lives attacking these rodents in their burrow, not when a little white phosphorus would flush them out.\n\nThe stench of garlic that phosphorus attacks always brought still hung in the air, even hours later. As the commander of the Purification Zone stepped through the improvised wall of wagons, he got his first look at what his orders had wrought. Twisted corpses, scattered like dolls around the campsite. Some were splayed out, clawing at the poisoned earth. Others huddled around each other even in death, the last remains of the degenerate families that had tried to flee his army. All were covered in the same burns that white phosphorus left. Deep scorch marks covering the entire body, skin so charred it became brittle, paperlike. Evtukovich felt nauseous. He hated garlic.\n\nHe was looking at the remains of what had once been a baby, cradled in its mothers arms, when he noticed one of the Shturmoviki officers approaching him. "We've rounded up the survivors sir, we're preparing to execute them now, with your permission."\n\nEvtukovich paused for a moment, as though he were contemplating some profound statement, before speaking, "Hold off, for now. Bring them back to the camp with us so we can get some use out of them." The officer snapped a smart salute and departed. Evtokovich turned back towards the body he'd been studying. It couldn't have been more than a year old. Such a little thing, and yet it had threatened everything he was fighting for, everything he loved. There was no other choice. There was no other choice."

If anyone asked him how he got here, he could not have told them. Life hadn't made sense for weeks, maybe years. He went where he was told to go, ate when and what he was told to eat, and killed whoever he was told to kill, knowing that if he said no, he was next. Nothing seemed connected any more, just moment after moment with no context but the dread he couldn't escape.\n\nThe rank in front of him came to a halt and Alexander did the same. Wherever they were going, they had arrived. At the front of the column he could see a gallows. There were around a dozen kneeling figures, hoods over their heads and nooses around their necks. In front of them, the commander was pacing back and forth as the Shturmoviki and the guardsmen assembled in perfect order. Around the soldiers a crowd of civilians had been assembled, brought to watch what Alexander now remembered was a victory parade.\n\nEvtokovich raised his bullhorn and began shouting into it. "People of Holy Russia! You have been brought here today to see the face of the enemy! This is the enemy which infests our motherland, conspiring to pollute our blood and deny us our God. This is the enemy which the brave men of the Guard, the warriors of the Holy Regent and the blessed Tsarevich will purge from our country no matter the cost! Look at this vermin!"\n\nWith that he tore off the hood of one of the prisoners, revealing a Tatar woman gagged with a rough cord. Even from this distance, Alexander could see the burns that covered her face, hear the muffled screams and sobs coming from behind the gag. Evtukovich went down the line, ripping off the sacks. Each time he did so a wave of jeers and shouts came from the crowd. Once they had all been unmasked, Evtukovich gave the signal to the hangman and the trapdoor dropped. As the bodies twitched and jerked, he raised the bullhorn one more time, while the soldiers applauded."

 #The Revolutionary Communes of Orenburg
 after_midnight.96.t:0 "Grain and Steel"
 after_midnight.96.desc:0 "The Bolshevik coup in the Southern Urals had been weeks in the making. No sooner had the earliest rumors of Taboritsky's death reached Mikhail Pervukhin's hideout in the mountains, than he set about preparing for the expulsion of Orenburg's isolated garrison. When it came, it was but a mere formality, with the imperials scattering at the first sight of an organized attack.\n\nGeneral Secretary Pervukhin, henceforth the competent authority in the areas which long ago had belonged to the eponymous anarchist council, quickly endeared himself to the local population by overseeing the liquidation of Taboritsky's regional kapos. He knew well enough, however, that the task of government would be far more unpleasant. Imperial rule had been particularly unkind to the Southern Urals: the fields which were not merely fallow lay poisoned, the factories that had not been entirely stripped had suffered some other form of ruination, internal commerce was nonexistent, an effective bureaucracy had never existed in the first place...Pervukhin sighed.\n\nLooking up at the map of the Southern Urals kindly left at Government House by its deceased prior occupant, the general secretary grimaced. It was an almost ancient map by this stage, produced during the later-days of Soviet rule, as marked by the CCCP watermark on its legend. That in and of itself was a reminder of the achievements of Bolshevik civilization; what little remained of a functional society could be traced back to the achievements of the Union alone.\n\nPervukhin's mind harkened back to the days of 1918 and 1921. Was Russia then no less savaged by reaction than it was now? Did the Bolshevik spirit, incarnate in Lenin, Kaganovich and Stalin, not suffice to overcome the penury of Russia's situation then? If those men had managed to thrust the vastness of the motherland into modernity, then he could put the pseudo-Makhnoite peasantry of a few oblasts back on the right track. That feat could be accomplished only through the methods of his mentors.\n\nMaterial balance planning, democratic centralism, and a strong Red Army were the correct ways to run a state, whether the uppity muzhik liked it or not. For their part, the anarchists should be content that after the demonstrated failure of their fantasy government, he was benevolent enough to allow their existence to be reflected in the country's new name: 'Revolutionary Communes of Orenburg' did have a nice appeal to them after all, even if there were no communes."

 after_midnight.97.desc:0 "The dire situation in greater Orenburg had necessitated the revival of the term, 'Spetz,' now applicable to the large number of former Ural League officers in the service of the commune's Red Army. With political commissars by their side, a handful of poor rifle slavemen underneath, and their close relatives under Cheka watch, these men became Pervukhin's military backbone.\n\nApart from the few raids by Kazakh purifiers in the south, however, the Urals Red Army was often more preoccupied with the 'Internal Enemies of the Revolution' than those on the outside. Initially, this was taken to mean what few sympathizers the Taboritsky regime had had in Orenburg, or what few local bourgeois organized to resist the expropriation of their factories. Nowadays, however, the term invariably described the anarchist peasantry, which had taken offence not only to policies of the revolutionary government, but to the general secretary himself.\n\nFor his part, Captain Lukomsky did not much blame the peasants. No sooner had the red flags been raised over Orenburg, than particularly pervasive, sometimes even cartoonish, depictions of Mikhail Pervukhin - whether in print or stone - became a staple of life in the communes. The cause of this particular unrest was the replacement of a statue in memory of the Orenburg's Worker Council, with one of Pervukhin, which depicted him standing right beside Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Lazar Kaganovich. Lukomsky thought it gross, and the peasants' distaste for it justified; but if his time in the Ural League's army had taught him anything, it was that orders were orders.\n\n"Fire." The three dozen Red Army men under his command opened up on the muzhik mob, as had by now become customary. The cold, miserable winter weather made the scene even more dreadful, as Lukomsky struggled to clear his nose while kicking away the bodies of anarchists which had fallen at the side of the statue they had attempted to topple. From the particular homes of the God-forsaken village, the political commissar and his chosen few brought back seized anarchist memorabilia to use as firewood. Black flags, deviationist literature, pornography. All these, it was decreed, should burn at the altar of the general secretary. And so they did."

This time, Red Russia would take no chances.\n\nThe muzhik anarchists had been too weak, or perhaps too high on the opiate of gospel, to do what was necessary. That was not so with the NKVD, whose list of clergymen - Taboritskyite or otherwise - had been steadily growing since the first few scraps of graffiti-penned kill lists redacted in the Bolsheviks' Ural hideouts.\n\nTo Vasily Alenxandrovich Petrov, the task was not particularly pleasant. Growing up during the first warlord era, religion had been present in his homestead: killing one's childhood is never easy. Nevertheless, the institution's collaboration with Taboritsky condemned it even in Petrov's eyes. And so, he led his dozen men into the temple, pushing away the few raggedly dressed priests who pleaded to prevent a ransacking.\n\n"If only they'd fought this hard against Taboritsky." Petrov's political officer let out a laugh as he demeaned a bearded man, clinging on to a Bible. Most of the company laughed - ever so uneasily - with him, as the butt of a Kalashnikov left the old man lying on the ground. The rest of the platoon, outside the church, fired off a warning shot at the local rabble, which had not taken long to notice what the bonfire was being set up for. While some, it should be said, were apathetic to the forcible seizure of holy books (as they were, by this point, to almost anything), the majority of people attempted some form of protest. Petrov had orders to deal with those by shooting, but he chose a more sensible approach. Not like their protestations would change anything, anyway.\n\n"

Everyone else pretended, and everyone else knew too. The dark clouds, a permanent testament to their fate, perhaps God's judgement to some, loomed over the collective farm almost every day. When he raised his hoe again and felt the poisoned earth, he breathed out something in annoyance, perhaps a curse word - he wasn't sure himself. Then, just as soon after he spoke, he heard the voice of Mikhail next to him, amidst the many other farmers nearby.\n\n"Irritated, are you now, Ilya?" He asked. Ilya heard, but both men continued working, as stopping was not an option. "This is the sweat and blood-" Mikhail took a sharp breath, "-that will be necessary for the spirit of communism to return, you know."\n\n"Again with the revolution farce..." Ilya sighed, and he could feel Mikhail become a little annoyed. He was a determined Bolshevik, that much Ilya knew, and when he found some satisfaction under Bukharin, he hated the communes, and then welcomed Pervukhin. "We're supposed to till this soil and make it arable in the span of two months. How in God's name are we supposed to do that?"\n"I can't say for sure, but a duty is a duty."

While it may have been seen as excessive and demonstrative of the exaltation of industry to hold the opening of an agricultural tools factory in such esteem, it truly was deserving of the importance. Taboritsky's reign of terror had so thoroughly ransacked the Southern Urals that the construction of even such a basic industry became a groundbreaking event, worthy of celebration and a Red Army parade.\n\nThe general secretary was of course present for the opening of the M.G. Pervukhin Agricultural Tooling Factory, as were the People's Commissars for Foreign Affairs, Labor, Industry, and Agriculture. Pervukhin was not alone however, with the People's Commissars for Military Affairs, Communications, Justice, and Education, also in attendance. There were a few important military figures, alongside what few technicians were available, all there to celebrate this great achievement of reborn Russian socialism. One group who shined through their absence however, were the workers themselves.\n\nIndeed, all workers with the technical skill to operate industrial machinery were over the mountains and far away, busily toiling in the collectivized farms. The food situation in the cities was so dire that they could hardly be spared for industrial production, that would be double whammy at any rate. Thus, Secretary Pervukhin had devised a solution which would be beneficial to all:\n\nWhat few members of the deposed government had not been executed, alongside the detained anarchist intellectuals, and Kazakhs taken prisoners during frontier battles, all had long sat at Cheka camps consuming the proletariat's food. Now, however, they would have to provide redemptive labor for it, with reduced rations of course, only fair in the face of the worsening agricultural crisis.\n\nSurely, these actions might be retroactively considered excessive, but as far as Pervukhin was concerned, they were just and necessary. When Russia once more found itself united and prospering under the Red Banner, it would be this factory they could trace national redemption to."

"Yes, Alek. This is it."\nIn contrast with the adult, the youth is a scrawny, thin teenager, pulling the cloth of the carriage, and glancing at the abandoned, wooden manor in the woods. The house looks completely abandoned, the once vibrant oak giving way to a greyish, almost sickly tone, the smell of mold perceptible even from this distance."\n\n"Is this where you and Uncle Vik-s-sorry, ouch, don't pull my ear!"\n\n"We don't speak the name of monsters in our home, Alek. Do you want to make your mother cry again?"\n\n"N-no, okay, I'm...I'm sorry, just stop pulling! It hurts!"\n\nThe father finally relents, the youth all but rubbing fiercely his ear. The father takes a deep breath, remembering the per- no...person is an insult, the animal that he once shared a roof and a life with.\n"...You don't remember, you were really small, but this is where I used to live. Your grandfather's grandfather built this house himself, with his own two hands, and work this land to sustain his own family, all the way down to us. Weren't for Kaganovich, you would have been raised here, not in some small hole in a wall in Chelyabinsk."\n"...anything's better than what's out there, father."\n\nThe silence stretches between the two of them before the taller man nods.\n\n"Glad you agree. Wake your mother and sister in the wagon. I'll set a campfire, and tomorrow we'll work to put some life back in this house."\n"And then?"\n"...we will survive. We have enough supplies to last a while, but we must stand on our own now. Your mother and sister will clean up the house tomorrow morning, and we'll be out to get anything we'll need."\n"D-does...does that mean you'll finally let me use your gun?!""

The man looked downright furious, yet flushed; either by his rage, or the cold of the landing road, she couldn't be sure. The air howled, yet it didn't seem to diminish the fury of the man's voice, as he raised his voice again, motioning to the warehouse at their side.\n"We can't just shrug and offer the other cheek when those psychopaths kill our people and poison our land even more! Haven't we suffered enough under the Regent's insanity, now we have to just twiddle our thumbs and keep waiting until Melkikh finishes the bloody job?!"\nShe listened to him, as he, the leader of them all, screamed himself hoarse as his argument collapsed more and more into an irrational, hateful speech against everything that befell them; the Russians that put them into shackles, the empire that turned these shackles into a noose, and now the bandits that seek to give the final twist to break their neck. Finally, all the rage and vitriol spilled out of him, leaving what really was Alexander Zvyagin, for those close to him: a scared, tired, young idealist, in a land marred by justified cynism.\n"We don't have the people, Alexander. Everyone is tired of fighting. We've fought for ten, long years, and what did we get from it? The land is even more broken than when I was up there, shooting at the Krauts myself. But you can't draw what simply is not there anymore. We can only endure-"\n"We will die."\nFor the first time in quite a while, Aglaya was shocked, staring at the broken person at her front; Alexander can't muster the energy to look at her in the face, pitifully looking at the ground beneath them as if it could give him any answer, any consolation, or any help at their situation.\n"We can't keep...hoping we can shoot them down forever. They'll...just keep chipping, more and more, until they reach Surgut. And then..."\nHis sentence was left unfinished, a grave silence stretching between both of them. And before Aglaya could say anything, he turned and went the way he came, his posture all but defeated."

It glowed softly as Melkikh puffed on his cigarette, the smoke billowing from his nostrils as he exhaled. He watched the tendrils of gray nothing dance like ghosts in the cold Siberian air, and he smiled. Ghosts, Russia was full of them. But Melkikh was not one of them, and neither were his men.\n\nIf Melkikh could use one word to describe the Russian race, it would be 'survivors'. They had outlived the tsar, the Nazis, and now the Blessed Regent. He sneered, or at least one of the Blessed Regents. Larionov was making noise in Vyatka, screaming at Melkikh down the phone to organize his helicopters and planes in defense of the city. The commander of the Imperial Airborne Brigades knew an opportunity when he saw one, and Larionov's Frankensteinian state was not long for this world.\n\nOut here in the Siberian wastes, he alone commanded air power, he alone had the guns and guts to take what he wanted. Fuck the Regent, fuck the empire, Melkikh was king of the skies.\n\nOne by one, the blades of the helicopters began to spin, the engines humming as the raptors prepared for takeoff, and as Melkikh stood watching his warriors ascend into the air, a smile crept across his face."

In a sudden, terrible moment, everything was light, heat, and noise. Lidka didn't realize she was screaming until her throat was raw. Splinters, earth and flesh were rent and thrown wildly by the explosion, and Lidka felt a wave of heat throw her from her prone position into the air.\n\nShe landed on her back some yards away, the wind torn from her lungs. As she struggled to breathe, she watched as the death-machines wheeled overhead. What could they do? A few brave souls had fired their rifles at the planes to no avail, their bodies quickly turned into wet scraps at the next strafe.\n\nLidka tried to push herself back up, but her limbs were unresponsive. She struggled to lift her head, hair, blood, and sweat clinging to her face.\n\nWhat remained of her body was a horror, a mess of charred meat and splintered bone, another casualty of Melkikh's rage.

The attack wing swept low over the bunker complex, probing for an opening in the Redeemed Black League's defenses.\n\nThere were none.\n\nThe fanatics held fast against the Imperial Airborne Brigades, their entrenched AA guns spitting showers of dearg into the sky. The gunner of Kolomnikov's chopper, a crazed, fearful expression on his face, pumped lead down on the gun emplacements, trying desperately to pick off the Black League defenders. Maybe if their guns could be neutralized - the gunner howled and careened back, clutching his face and screaming as blood gouted from his jaw.\n\nInstinctually, Kolomnikov leapt over the fallen gunner to take his place, gripping the machine gun in his sweaty hands.\n\nJust as he began to return fire down at the black garbed figures that guarded the concrete hellscape, and as casings pinged and rattled around his feet, Kolomnikov felt his mouth dry and his bowels turn to water as an AA gun turned towards his chopper.\n\nThe flak tore through the soft skin of the helicopter with ease, like a giant punching a fly. The cabin shook violently, and Kolomnikov was thrown from his feet as the chopper began its death spiral. In a swirl of sound and blurred colors, Kolomnikov was tossed around the cabin, only the grace of centripetal force keeping him inside the helicopter.\n\nThe howl of tortured metal and the kinetic scream of impact greeted Kolomnikov as his chariot met the rising earth, glass and wreckage showering him and those few who had survived the crash. Pain greeted Kolomnikov, searing, agonizing pain, as he struggled to right himself and extract his limp body from the wreckage. As he glanced out the crumpled door of the chopper, he felt as though he might cry. Rushing through the trench the chopper had fallen into were soldiers of the Black League, rifles at the ready.

The helicopter fleet had been winterized in preparation for raids deep into Siberia long before the collapse of the Holy Russian Empire, and not once had the chopper horde been grounded. Melkikh would not suffer the disobedience of Mother Nature, and no weather report would discourage him from taking what was rightfully his.\n\nThat had been weeks ago, and now the company that had embarked for a raid into Nenets territory was lost in perpetual white. Chopper pilots strained to see through the driving snow of the blizzard, holding their controls in white-knuckled death grips. None dared to turn back, for to return to the air marshal without loot was to face summary execution.\n\nThe wind and snow wreaked havoc on the blades, and the first chopper that was pushed down to earth by the hoary hand of Boreas landed with a dull crump. The distress of the stricken crew was heard over the radios of the squadron, who initially believed that the Nenets had acquired a rocket. As one chopper scrambled to face the nonexistent enemy, it blundered blindly into its brother, sending them both careening to the ground in a suddenly bright orange fireball.\n\nWhen the Nenets scouts found the wreckage, there was no sign of the crew save for the few corpses frozen solid by the icy winds of Siberia and the wolf tracks leading off into the forest."

Fighters darted in and out of the bomber formation, the few fighters in Melkikh's fleet scrambling to intercept. Choppers and bombers burst with throaty explosions or trailed smoke as they crashed into the Urals below.\n\n"Where the fuck did they come from?" shouted the air marshal from his chopper, watching through the canopy in disbelief as the swooping fighters tore into his precious fleet. There had to be at a dozen of them, all older Soviet planes, proudly emblazoned with the red star of the old Union. The fighters, long time heroes of Siberia, were unmistakable: the Free Aviators.\n\nHelicopters fired mounted machine guns fruitlessly at the passing fighters, the Free Aviators easily spinning to avoid the line of tracers. Melkikh's gunner was shoved off the gun by the air marshal himself, who grasped the machine gun and swung it towards his enemy. The gun shook, bright tracer rounds illuminating the night sky, seeking the death of the witches. A Soviet plane careened to the left as Melkikh riddled its left wing with bullets, smoke trailing from behind the stricken fighter. All around the aerial duelists, and explosions shook the sky as raiders and Free Aviators killed and died alike.\n\nAs choppers fell from the sky and bombers exploded midair, Melkikh felt his gun cough, the last of the casings clinking to the floor. "Fuck!" the Air Marshal shouted, dismounting the weapon. A cold sweat began to percolate on his brow as he slowly came to the realization that the fight was hopeless. "Pull back! Return to base!" screamed Melkikh down the radio. As one, the fleet turned to flee.\n\nThough they were harassed the whole way back, the Free Aviators peeled off shortly before the fleet touched down. Melkikh was incensed, coming off of his chopper ranting and raving. "I!" He screamed to raiders, "I alone am the master of Russia's skies! When this is finished, the Free Aviators will be forgotten!

Within the chaos of the Russian Anarchy he had shaped himself into a thief, stealing whatever he needed to survive from those too weak to protect their possessions. As the shadow of Taboritsky's regime stretched across Russia, he was imprisoned and sentenced to die. He thought his luck was shifting when the Redeemed Black League sprung him from prison during the chaos of Regency's collapse. However, looking at what was supposed to be his 'training camp' he knew that thought to be foolish.\n\nHe recognized the people around him; they were fellow prisoners he knew from his time behind bars, murderers and thieves. They were surrounded by towering steel walls, with faceless guards manning the battlements staring right through each and every 'recruit', waiting for them to step even an inch out of line. Their 'barracks' was a crowded tent filled with lumpy beds that lacked pillows or blankets. There was no place for any of them to store personal possessions or even spare sets of clothes. They were expected to wear the one uniform they were granted at all times, a constant reminder of who they were supposed to be.\n\nThere was not enough of anything to go around. Not enough equipment, not enough beds, not enough food. They were expected to fight for their right to live, for the "redemption" that they were offered from this new Black League. So that is what they did, each and every recruit fought for every scrap of food that they could, while the masked guards on the walls watched them, assessing them all.\n\nAs time went on they were privileged to be visited by a small team of drill sergeants. These men would begin the arduous process of taming the wild animals that they had created. Week by week, drill by drill, the recruits were trained. Once, when Viktor beat another recruit in a fight, he was awarded with an additional serving of food, the loser sent into solitary confinement without food."

If the Black League was to survive this Great Trial and prevail against the masses of barbaric warlords then they must forge a nation of iron, one that will not bend or break to the invading hordes. To achieve this he and his staff had put together the Militarized Village Program, an initiative to concentrate the Black League's population into easy to defend strongholds and fortify them to withstand any enemy incursion.\n\nHe and the rest of the Black League knew that these people would resist being relocated, weakened by sentimentality and a poorly placed pride in their heritage. This mattered not to Lazarenko or his staff. These people were not true members of the Black League, instead they were mere pawns to be used in the furthering of the Black League's interests. They would be relocated at gunpoint regardless of their wishes, anyone who resisted would be shot without warning.\n\nConcentrating everybody into these strongholds also possessed another upside for the Black League. These peasants would be easy to survey and control. Under the watchful eye of the Black League, Lazarenko could make sure that these peasants served their purpose in the Great Trial. They would provide their labor, their minds, their possessions, and their lives, all in an effort towards the League's greater goal.\n\nIt was the duty of Lazarenko and the Redeemed Black League to save Russia from itself. The reason she had failed in all of the prior trials was due to her unruly and savage people. Yazov's great failing was his inability to see this immutable truth. This new League will raise generations of true Russians, Russians that will give anything, including their life, for the Black League."

Corpses had begun to gather all around the camps, with more piling up everyday. At first, the stench had been unbearable for him and the rest of the "recruits", but after a while their noses had gone numb to it. Some of them starved to death, unable to fight for their right to eat, others had died from diseases due to the increasingly filthy nature of the camp. The rest had been killed, either by the guards or their fellow recruits.\n\nThose who remained had changed from their time spent within the camp. They had become more violent, acting almost like rabid beasts rather than human beings. Altercations over food or equipment escalated from fist fights into brutal life or death combat. Everybody fought like they like their life depended on it because they all knew that it did. In this place Viktor had no friends, just rivals for survival.\n\nOnce a week, members of the Black League visited to check up on the progress of their recruits and to provide combat training. These were the only men the recruits truly feared. Anything that could be considered a slight towards a ranking officer was punished severely. A week in solitary for minor offenses, and death for major offenses. Like rabid dogs wearing shock collars, the only thing these recruits truly feared was their masters.\n\nDuring his time at the camp, Viktor learned every way he could possibly kill a person. Through instruction from the Black League and his own personal experience fighting for his life he had been made into a skilled killer. Only the strong could survive the Black League's "recruitment" process, and Viktor refused to die here, no matter the cost."

They were not living under the imperial government anymore though, for the Black League had returned.\n\nAlthough they wrapped themselves in the imagery and style of the old Black League, this new League was very different. Their sworn enemy was no longer the Germanic Teutons - instead they found their enemy in the very people of Russia. They blamed their fellow Russians for their failures to defeat Germany, time and time again. The result was a regime that did not even see their citizens as people, instead they were resources to use in raising future generations of Black League zealots.\n\nThe streets of Sverdlovsk were lined with men of the Internal Security Directorate. Their faces were covered with gas masks and their arms carried assault rifles. They watched the city's residents, punishing even the most minor of transgressions with extreme cruelty. At night, the men of the ISD raid the homes of everyday citizens, taking any form of personal possession forbidden by the Black League. Harmless trinkets like comic books and children's toys were stolen and destroyed.

Her thoughts were interrupted as a stray bullet emerged from her window, grazing her shoulder. Backing away from the window she knew she had to escape. Rushing to a small shack near her house, another stray bullet grazed her leg. It took all her willpower to not draw attention to herself by screaming.\n\nThese 'soldiers' fought more like rabid animals than human beings. Their rifles were all mismatched, afixed with sharpened scraps of metal to serve as makeshift bayonets. As they ran out of ammo in their weapons, rather than reload most of them just dropped their weapons and began to kill people with their own hands or knives. The men of the Black League spared nobody, not even the children.\n\nThe brutality they unleashed upon this small village was almost puzzling. Katerina had seen her village suffer raids many times before, but those men were sadistic, they engaged in cruelty for their own enjoyment. These men however, did not seem to enjoy any of the horrors they were unleashing upon her people. In fact, in the brief glimpses she got of their faces, they didn't seem to feel anything at all. They showed zero emotion as they mercilessly slaughtered this village. Not enjoyment nor regret, not pleasure nor pain. It was as if they were not even present anymore.\n\nStill in the small shack and fearing for her life, Katerina waited for all of the 'soldiers' around her to be occupied. It pained her to use the suffering and deaths of people she once thought of as friends to escape this, but she had no other option. When she thought an opportunity presented itself she bolted from the shack heading east. Unfortunately for her, someone had taken notice.

He was alone, in a land far different from the Siberian village he grew up in, and filled with subhumans he'd swore to purify in the name of the Holy Russian Empire.\nYet in spite of being seemingly stranded in a forsaken land, he kept hoping that he'd hear anything on his radio, anything that would give him some semblance of hope. And for a second, it seemed as if his hopes were coming true as the radio picked up a signal: "To all the Russian dogs still defiling these lands, the time of retribution has come for you. The crimes committed by the Mad Regent and his rabid dogs shall be avenged: for every slight committed against the Kazakh people, it shall be punished tenfold. I, Safa Gaziz, Grand Marshal of the Purification Army make this promise. We will come for you, your wives and children, your precious homes and churches, and your beloved motherland. As you plundered our lands and smothered our blue sky into one as black as your heart, so shall we. The sons of Genghis and Tamerlane shall bring fear to Russia once more!"\n\nThe soldier felt disgust, as well as amazement that a Kazakh would even be able to handle any kind of technology.

As their houses burned and their neighbors laid dead, the remaining villagers tried fleeing to the sea in a last ditch effort to save their pathetic lives.\n\nA futile effort. From the banks of the sea, the soldiers of the KPA would gun them down as they stood on top of their horses.

Worse, some had even mingled with those devils, diluting the pure blood of the Kazakh population over time.\n\nA divided house now finds itself at a crossroad: should it find peace in letting old wounds be healed over time, leaving families reuniting despite differences? Or are some lines meant to not be crossed? Evidently, Gaziz had no want for peaceful reconciliation in his mind as he ordered "race traitors" to be purged.\n\nDay and night, the KPA soldiers took care of the question: they tortured and hanged those who fought under the USSR, leaving their corpses as warning at the entrances of Aktau.

Some of those who had come from the west had warned of Kazakhs who were led by butchers, who emulated the Mad Regent and his propensity to slaughter. However, Hanifa was surprisingly calm, as were many others. Those people were driven by rage and hate, much like the regency had been. It was unsustainable. And like the Holy Russian Empire, it would destroy itself in time.\n\nAnd when it did, a new, free Kazakhstan would rise."

Finally, she finished, and fired it. She was rewarded with the sight of an explosion a short distance away. She let out a sigh of relief, proud of herself for managing it in the live-fire exercise. A number of other explosions sounded as the other women in her unit did the same.\n\n"Again." Officer Rustemov ordered. He was an old veteran of the Kazakh Red Army, a man missing an eye and with a patchy beard. He had been heavily involved in drilling the militia units that had been formed in recent weeks. The genocidal men to their west, and the concern that what emerged from the remnants of Russia may attempt to reclaim Kazakhstan had driven the need to have a fighting force - even if it had to be built from the ground up.\n\nThere was no shortage of volunteers, and thanks to the amount of weapons and ordinance that had been left behind or abandoned by the Russians, they didn't have to worry about supplies. It wasn't enough for an army - but it was enough for them. She'd barely known how to fire a gun, but the vivid memories of the Russians invading, and being unable to fight back had instilled in her a desire to never be helpless again.\n\nIf there was ever another army that marched upon them, be they from the west or north, at least she'd die fighting back. Twilight turned the sky orange, and after a few more hours of drills, they were sufficiently tired. Rustemov ordered them to stop. "Drills are done for the day. Take a rest. You've earned it." Aida and the rest of the women smiled. Rustemov was tight-lipped with his compliments, so hearing one was gratifying.\n\n"Yes sir." She brought up a hand in a salute, echoed by the others, and turned to leave, chatting with each other, with rifles slung over their shoulders."

Hills roll in a similar writhing agony, scattered with shocks and scars of gaunt trees. Putrid air clouds the ground and clings tight to the direction of the wind.\n\nIf one were to continue their journey, they may find the remains of a granary, once home to vast quantities of golden wheat, its colour soft as summer sun, all carefully deposited by a farmer's toughened hands. A home would be close by, it would have been filled with all the things this farmer loved in this world. Now it too stands abandoned, inhabited by nothing but the same unrelenting, toxic atmosphere.\n\nFew refuges can be sustained; those that do cling to life in the carcasses of old towns, with supplies dwindling and fears rising. Many have instead come to embrace a nomadic life, reliving the customs of the past; with hardened skin they return to the earth, scraping away at whatever they can find. These people spend their days in shock, with nothing to sustain their future, but their nation prevails, as a dim spirit haunting its hollow land.\n\nThough the plagues brought in by the invaders tore their land apart, they managed to persist. Though their muscles ache and minds yearn to escape, they persist. In the death of the old a new life emerges, mirroring that which came long before, and so they shall persist. This land was not home to Kazakhs alone, even since before the recent vile deluge swept the ground bare, there had been Russians living alongside them. Though they may not have always been peaceful, they had grown accustomed to each other's existence.\n\nThe Russians had been as much victims of the indiscriminate carnage as the Kazakhs. They had been strune far across the steppes, cut-off from the past; all those who had survived at least.

Everyone had been strewn throughout the steppes, cut-off from the past and held hostage by the present - all those who had survived at least. These few were left were now subjucated by the terrible spectre of the future.\n\nSmall bands of refugees are all that remains of the Russian communities, they hobble across the landscape in the same way their Kazakh neighbours now do. However, their lives are plagued by a constant uncertainty, worse even than the Kazakhs. They can never tell where they will be welcome, or if another band mistakes them as an enemy. The relentless anxiety of the land hounds them.\n\nWith little left to choose, one by one, they settle down in attempts to live off the land. Their new way of life, melting into the pastoralist culture of the Kazakhs.

 after_midnight.132.desc: "Once, the foundation of a nation would have been met with fanfare, excitement, and hope from its populace. Within the cities of Perm and Zlatoust and all the outlying towns and villages, however, there was only silence. It was a melancholy silence, one that had been born of the terror of the Mad Regent's regime. Where once the people of these lands had held hope within their hearts, now there was nothing but a silent resolve.\n\nIn the small town of Mezhgorye, Hadji-Umar Mamsurov stood before a small crowd of former Ural Guard, NKVD, and 3rd Army soldiers along with many natives of the region around Mount Yamantau. He was here to be sworn in as the first president of the newly formed Trans-Ural Confederation. To his left, his adjutant gave him a thumbs up. Within the lands under the tentative control of the confederation, the masses huddled around old radios to hear their leader's speech.\n\nThe old soldier steadied himself before beginning his speech. "I have never been one for speeches, so I will try to keep this brief," he began. "It has been only scant months since the unification of Russia under the boot of the Mad Regent, yet in that time his dogs have brought untold ruin to the people of Russia. Thousands slaughtered in this mad quest for a dead child. Now, he is dead, and the long road to recovery has begun. I stand here today, not simply as your leader, no. I stand here as merely a man, chosen to lead you through the night and into a better dawn," he stopped there and weighed his next words carefully. When next he spoke he swore an oath, before God and the people of the confederation, that unknowingly mirrored one made by the founder of the Ural League years before him.\n\nHe pledged an oath of servitude to the people and spoke with passion in his heart that he would fight to his dying breath to protect them. This oath would be sworn by every one of his successors until the day finally came for the confederation to end, for better or worse."

But these men were not mere refugees. They had a purpose. A goal. One driven by faith and gratitude for and towards one whom they all considered the greatest man any ever met.\n\nThat man was Jānis Mendriks.\n\nTo him, all of them, whether Balt or Pole or any other, had been first and foremost a victim of the Soviet state's infamous gulags. They all remembered well the hardship, the senseless violence, the deprivation and, above all, the hopelessness felt when shackled within them. In the fall of the state to the Germans, however, they had gained their freedom. Something they, at that point and little better than animals themselves, had little use for. They all knew how close they had been to the edge.\n\nUntil Mendriks had shown them a better way. Shown them that they could co-operate and fight to protect God's children, and in so doing save themselves from darkness. Through their years fighting with the Ural League, they had all seen ample evidence of that darkness, indeed. Even so, none of them had been prepared for the horror that was Taboritsky's Russia.\n\nBut, using the principles Mendriks had imparted to them, they had all survived by helping and fighting for each other. But they had needed a mission. A purpose. And they had found it. They intended to travel to Rome. It would be a long and difficult journey through inhospitable terrain and dangerously unstable statelets across the ideological spectrum. But they would do it, or die trying.\n\nFor they all knew, in their heart of hearts, that Mendriks was truly a saint. It only needed to be made official. They would ensure it was."

He had been tasked by his higher-ups in the Ural Purification Zone to lead a raid on the degenerates and Jews that had taken over Perm and Zlatoust, and, at first, the operation was a success; the village they had descended on had no idea what had hit them. However, they were surrounded and picked off by bastard Ural Guardsmen and some remnant of Batov's lot. Now he sat, beaten and bruised by his captors, as some mongrel whore read off a list of his so-called crimes.\n\nHadji-Umar Mamsurov presided over the first of many trials that would set an important precedent for the future of the confederation. When the bastard Colonel Bolsunov had been dragged before him he had been ever so tempted to simply have the man executed out of hand. He had been personally responsible for the deaths of thousands of Russian citizens since he joined the Shturmoviki and Mamsurov would have liked nothing more than to put a bullet into him himself. But that wasn't the right course of action, and so he had authorized military trials for Bolsunov and those of his men that survived the fighting outside Perm. Of course, for all that this was a legitimate trial, the verdict was never in question.\n\n"Roman Ulyanovich Bolsunov, you have been brought before this tribunal to answer for your crimes against the people of Russia. You stand accused of treason, murder, extortion, and the use of poison gas on civilian populations. How do you plead?"\n\n"I admit to no crime! This trial is a farce, controlled by Jews and mongrels! You will all burn in hell for your actions!" the man raved.

Today, it served a different purpose - a welcoming room for an esteemed guest. The door closed behind Mamsurov, and he regarded the weathered figure who once owned this land like it was his mansion.\n\n"Mikhail Kalashnikov." Mamsurov began, and the man wearily raised his head in acknowledgement. Kalashnikov was not as Mamsurov had seen in so many reels of footage, so many pictures of parades and factories. To say he'd lost weight was an understatement - his cheekbones jutted from his face, highlighting his sunken eyes, and his winter jacket loosely hung from his hunched form. A scar dragged itself across his cheek, trailing off at his jawline, making Mamsurov wince on instinct. "I wish we could have met under better circumstances."\n\n"I do too, comrade." Kalashnikov's voice was low and quiet, and a silence hung in the air as both men considered their next words. "I suppose this...is not just a friendly meeting."\n\n"I'm afraid not." Mamsurov pulled an envelope from his pocket. "Our engineers could use training from a designer with your level of skill - Lord knows we need the weaponry, with the madmen we call our neighbors. Payment will be-"\n\n"Payment?" Kalashnikov looked up with the most force Mamsurov had seen out of the man so far. "You think I still care about payment? Look at me. Look at my-" He raised his right hand, showing the stumps of what were once fingers. "I'm old. I'm...dying. I couldn't give less of a shit about payment. The least I can do is teach those to come after me how to build a rifle." He paused, taking a deep, rattling breath.

Mendriks and the other soldiers took him in, a no-life thief, and shaped him into a man, with something to live for, something to protect. The Yasha of old wouldn't ever sacrifice anything for anyone, but Yasha remembers vividly and proudly the memories of hastily assembling sandbags on an abandoned house, the faint memories of Dirlewanger's pillager's cars roaring in the distance...\nSuccess was hard on and almost made up the loss of part of his ear to a stray shot that day...\n\nThen, the dammable Regent, and his twisted corpse of an empire came...\n\nThey've tried their best. They, really, really did. Yasha pushes his wheelchair, one of the wheels slightly rusty, and harder to push than the other, and one of the tires clearly empty, and yet was nothing short of a commodity around these parts. Half of his face is permanently paralyzed, making it fairly awkward to breathe with only one active nostril; his legs are gone, replaced by wooden pegs, and burns across his body, Yasha looks much older than any forty-odd year veteran has any right to be.\nYet he's alive. And as he lowers a wreath with his good arm, surrounded by veterans like him, covered in their war tales, he can't help but cry, as the memories flood the young, yet aged soul. The statue is a recent thing, built from remaining rubble, the fruit of a surviving sculptor, fled from the harrowing shadow that befell what remained of his home in Sverdlovsk, depict a man he never met, but heard tales from other veterans, and came to admire as much as he did Mendriks himself; Pavel Batov, cradling a dying Ural Guards soldier, a scene he came to see so many times...\nWith immense effort, he did one shaky salute, to the patriot he never met, but felt he knew for ages."

 ## Chenlyabisnk Institute
 after_midnight.137.t: "The Stars Shine On"
 after_midnight.137.desc: "Nikolai Kardashev lifted his head from the paperwork he had been working through all night. Through the full-length window which replaced one of the walls of his office, countless dots of sparkling and shining lights contrasted against the pitch-dark and onyx-black tapestry of space. Even in the unending nightmare which was now Russia, some things - like the enigmatic sky - would always stay constant.\n\nWhere the factories and apartment blocks littering the Siberian municipality would once years ago shine with industrial floodlights late into the darkest hours of the night, there was now utter darkness. That nighttime glow and buzz was what had previously eclipsed the stars above; it was only with their extinguishing that he could see their radiance. The city, and purportedly many others, had been cut off from the power grid for weeks as the nation fell into utter chaos. Hunger and poverty was everywhere - even more so than under that madman Taboritsky's empire, and there was not enough food or even water to go around. Would Chelyabinsk or Russia ever heal from the three injuries she had been afflicted with - the two Great Patriotic Wars and now the lunatic's rule?\n\nYet, in spite of the crushing sorrow and despair all around him, Kardashev stayed hopeful. Like the stars he glimpsed, there were those things which would be eternal and unchanging. The days of dictators and tyrants, of Taboritskies and Hitlers, would eventually pass with time, and Russia would rebuild what was left of herself. They always did, and they will again. Through it all, it would be science - knowledge, enlightenment, and all the good virtues of truth - which would prevail without fail. Its survival here in Chelyabinsk was the strongest proof he could've asked for. He merely hoped his own efforts would not be wasted."

"Uh, we're not sure."\n\n"Any new findings on the equipment Taboritsky left us?"\n\n"Not much. We-"\n\n"And how about the refugees coming from the west? How many are there? Where are they being kept?"\n\n"We don't have enough data on that either."\n\nKardashev's head throbbed with a migraine as he considered the information his ministers had presented to him - or, more aptly, the absence of information which they had informed him of.\n\nHe knew that the path to building a utopia would be a rocky one - one filled with countless obstacles and hurdles, and whose diverging paths would be fogged and unclear - but there would at least be some direction to his labors. Without any solid information of what was actually going on in Chelyabinsk, even how the road should begin was unknown.\n\nKardashev, after all, was devoted to science - he was a career physicist - and what did science value most? Data. Without it, what could he and his ministers know for certain? Without it, how could even the most simple jobs be performed optimally? How could he know whether their policies were actually working as intended or delivering results?\n\nHe dismissed the council, telling them once more to brainstorm ways to accrue data, and reminding them of the importance of the first task of the Institute. Yet, in everyone's minds there, dread had settled - dread of not being able to live up to their dreams, of failing to make something better out of the ruins of old Russia, and of leaving the sick and the tired to their damned fates."

 after_midnight.139.desc: "The conference had been called by Comrade Kardashev to discuss the direction that the newly-founded Chelyabinsk Institute should follow, as well as the needs of the citizens of the city. Amongst those assembled were formerly seasoned politicians and officials from the local government of Chelyabinsk prior to the conquest of West Siberia, the handful of competent bureaucrats and administrators still left in the area, and Kardashev's kindred scientists and experts.\n\nThe debate would begin with the hunger crisis. With the black void of data they had, it was difficult to properly formulate a response; no one really knew what the people were going through, how severe the shortages were, or how many were affected by them. The conclusion of the conference was that the crisis was very severe if only taking into account official importation of food as reported at the border, but was realistically less severe, a statement which in no way could give any information on the actual availability of food for the average citizen.\n\nThen there was the matter of allocating other resources - goods not required for survival but greatly important to the functioning of modern society such as gas for heating and electricity. Those needs, however, came not just from the citizens, but also from industry and commercial entities, as well as the government. How were they to be distributed? Again, lack of information was a critical issue, as the committee didn't know what areas were most severely lacking in said resources nor agreed on what needed it most. For instance, Kardashev's scientist clique were fond of using calculations and planning to allocate resources to the mathematically most important channels - for instance, industry for production of other important goods, perhaps at the expense of the commercial sector or some parts of the population.\n\nIn the end, the conference only solidified the need for a thorough census and survey to gather information, resulting in little actual change in policy or opinion amongst the governing committee of the Institute."

His brother had died to the Taborite chambers of the empire, and he had only narrowly escaped the grip of the Regent's government through wit and sheer luck. Though they seemed a little out of touch and idealistic, Dmitry didn't care as long as he wasn't hunted down for minor infractions or gassed for being distantly related to a Freemason. They promised to rebuild the city, to provide for its people, and to establish a new society - and who could disagree with that, after years of suffering and anguish?\n\nYet, it was too good to be true. His initial impression of the scientist clique being elitist and aloof turned out to be correct - it had been months since they took over the city, but basic access to food and water was still rare in his neighborhood, while officials proclaimed that progress was being made and spouted on and on the same rubbish about sacrifice. If any change was happening, he definitely wasn't seeing it.\n\n"Give us bread!"\n\nCertainly, neither were the thousands who were marching with him in protest to petition the government to allocate more food, medicine, and gas to the needy. He was one of the luckier ones - he wasn't malnourished or ill as many others in the crowd were, but he had seen his neighbors and relatives struggle to get by. That was why he'd chosen to take action and join the protest, organized by workers who had been disgruntled with shortage after shortage. He had had his own fair share of starvation during the reign of Taboritsky, and had only recently been able to have real meals again. Others had not been so fortunate, and their pain had not been soothed by Kardashev's taking power."

They've gotten far more militant today, and my secretary told me they tried to break in."\n\nAn awkward silence cast itself across the room. The security minister finally piped up after several long moments. "It has to do with last night." He nodded at the other two representatives of the security forces in the room. "To give you the long and short of it, amidst the tensions in the protests yesterday, a few of our men got spooked and opened live fire. Six confirmed dead as of right now, and three others severely injured as a direct or indirect result of their actions."\n\nThe room was silent, stunned for a moment, before it broke out into frenzied discussion in whispers between members next to each other. One advisor, an esteemed scientist, spoke up, his face blanched\n\n"This will be a PR disaster for us, Comrade Kardashev, if what Smolyakov is saying is true."\n\n"PR disaster? Are you hearing yourself? We have the blood of six people on our hands!"\n\n"I understand that it is a tragedy, comrade, but we must-"\n\n"But what?! Can you think of anything other than our reputation or control for once?" He raged.

Staccato gunfire rang through the halls of the apartment bloc, and Sharkov felt his blood run cold as he realized he could hear heavy booted feet making their way towards his door. The aide to the minister of security leapt from his bed, nearly tangling himself in his sheets as he made his way to the front of his apartment. Did he remember to lock the door that night? What was going on? Who was shooting who?\n\nSharkov made it to the door just in time for the footfalls to stop right outside his door. He looked down at the bolt, and to his horror, saw that he had failed to slide it into place. A stupid, careless mistake that might cost him his life. Sharkov grabbed the knob so hard that his knuckles whitened, just as whoever was outside his door attempted to turn it.\n\nSweating with terror and with tears pooling in his eyes, Sharkov tried to hold the knob steady, but whoever was on the other side shoved against the door hard, sending the administrator sprawling to the ground. Shturmoviki entered the apartment, rifles held with a self-righteous swagger and eyes burning with dead light. One of the brutes leveled the barrel of a rifle at Sharkov's face and asked, "Who is the Blessed Regent?"\n\nSharkov blinked, "what?" The rifle inched closer, now directly between his eyes.\n\n"Who is the Blessed Regent?" the Shturmovik repeated, ice in his voice.\n\nSharkov, now having emptied his bladder in fear, managed to stammer out, "T-Taborit-" the gunshot blew blood, chunks of brain, skull fragments, and clumps of hair over the carpet, gruesomely peeling away the back of Sharkov's head.

Soon, Stepan knew, the deadly fog would fill the chamber and the crying, shaking masses would die. He closed his eyes, trying not to think of the stink of unwashed, terrified humanity or the weeping of his fellow prisoners. But the gas never came.\n\nA Shturmovik officer rushed into the gas chamber, flanked by his bodyguards, "By order of the Blessed Regent, your execution is forestalled indefinitely, step out into the hallway, please." Surprised, suspicious, and overjoyed, Stepan and the other prisoners began to file out of the killing room. What was this all about? Was the new regent a kinder man than Taboritsky? As the naked masses reached the hall way, a squad of Shturmoviki with submachine guns awaited them. "Against the wall, please," said the officer, gesturing with his pistol. The confused prisoners obeyed. Were they to be shot? Why not gas them?\n\nThe officer produced a sheet of paper and began to rattle off a list of names. Stepan did not hear his. "Step forwards," said the officer once he had finished reading, and a number of the selected prisoners did so. The officer turned and began to leave with his catch.\n\n"Take us with you!" shouted one prisoner, a young woman who would have been beautiful were she not so skeletally starved. "You can't leave us!" Stepan was about to say the same when the Shturmoviki raised their guns and began to fire.

The Shturmoviki under his command had quietly burned the Regent's corpse weeks ago, but the masses didn't know this. So, then, a public funeral for the old man was to be arranged, something to placate the plebians.\n\nHe began to type, detailing the funeral, closed casket, of course. The people were not holy enough to look upon Taboritsky's face, besides, that same face had been squirming with insects before it was consumed by flames. The casket would be weighted, but devoid of any corpse. A priest of Taboritsky's own sect would perform the ceremony, of course, but Larionov would march at the front of the procession.

Larionov played the part of the mournful heir brilliantly, keeping a grim visage for the benefit of his own entourage and for the lookers on.\n\nAt last, they reached the appointed place, the cathedral graveyard where Taboritsky would be buried. The casket was lowered into the freshly dug hole, prayers spilling from the lips of all those present. Larionov stood near the grave, hands clasped. "Today, we send our dearly beloved Sergei Taboritsky to join Our Father in Heaven, to serve as His right hand in death as he did in life. Never has the world seen such a devout warrior of Christ, never will we see his like again. Though we mourn his passing, we must give thanks to the Lord for having delivered him unto us.

No, not a lie, Taboritsky's diary revealed he had been deeply devoted to Alexei, so it wasn't some Jewish plot to destroy Russia.

Looks of horror crossed the faces of the chieftains, whilst others purpled in rage.

Onlookers gasped, adopted expressions of surprise, or said nothing as they shuffled away from the propaganda car. Lukova did nothing, said nothing, there was no point in doing so. Taboritsky a Jew? Surely, that had to be a lie.\n\n"Like all Jews," continued the voice of the Blessed Regent, "Taboritsky possessed a twisted mind, and I tell you with sorrow that he planned to murder Alexei as a sacrifice to his Hebrew deity when our beloved Tsarevich returned.

United by little more than blood, faith, and a will to live as free men, the surviving people of Kazakhstan have joined together in an independent democratic confederation.\n\nThe peoples' shared suffering under the regent has left most with nothing but disdain for autocracy, and an enthusiastic support for a new democracy based on the Islamic principle of Shura. The towns and clans of the new republic are highly autonomous, coming together chiefly for the purposes of national defense and mutual aid. Though they have only just begun the long road to recovery, the Kazakh people stand united and free against all who would seek to resubjugate them.\n"

 WORLD.18111.d:0 "신성 러시아 제국의 축복받은 섭정 세르게이 타보리츠키, 그가 죽었습니다.\n\n그의 뒤를 따라, 그가 오래전에 죽은 차레비치 알렉세이 로마노프의 이름으로 건설한 제국도 무너졌습니다. 그가 지은 모든 건물들, 반짝이는 성당들, 화려한 저택들은 완전한 파멸을 맞이하여 소금물에 떠내려가고 있습니다. 땅은 소금에 절여졌고, 사람들은 흩어졌습니다. 수백만의 생명이, 러시아인이나 다른 이들 모두, 촛불처럼 꺼졌습니다. 그들의 피와 뼈와 썩은 살은 그 땅에 그러한 것처럼 러시아의 영혼을 포화상태로 만듭니다. 그들이 나락으로 비명을 지르며 보내졌을 때, 조국도 마찬가지였습니다.\n\n그러한 추락으로부터, 구원은 없을 것입니다. 아마도, 앞으로 수십 년 동안 러시아는 기어들어가고, 검게 변한채, 잿더미속에 있을것이고, 영원히 상처입고 훼손당한, 엄청난 충격을 받고 눈물을 흘리며 썩어들어가는 옷을 입은 노파의 모습으로, 두 발로 간신히 서 있을 수 있을 것입니다. 하느님께서 러시아의 땅을 내려다 보실 것이고, 그것의 결핍을 아실 것입니다.\n"
