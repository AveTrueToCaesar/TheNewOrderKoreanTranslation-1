 POLITICS_TSAR_MIKHAIL_DESC:0 "미하일 안드레예비치 로마노프 왕자는 베르사유에서 태어나 스코틀랜드에서 자랐고 런던에서 공부했으며 2차 세계대전 동안에는 오스트레일리아에서 왕립 해군 소속으로 참전했습니다. 조국으로 돌아갈 수 있을지도 모른다는 실낱같은 희망이 나치가 승리를 거두면서 절대로 이룰 수 없는 꿈이 되어 버렸고, 독일은 서둘러 전쟁이 끝난 이후 모스코빈 국가판무관부를 수립했습니다. 결국 미하알 왕자는 오스트레일리아에서 평범한 시민으로 정착했고, 별로 주목받지 않는 항공 기술자로 살아갔습니다.\n\n하얼빈에서 초대장이 날아오기 전까지는 말이죠.\n\n백계 러시아인 몇명과 가졌던 저녁 파티에서 시작한 조촐한 모임은 점차 커졌고 어느새 미하일은 군사적 모험과 파벌 싸움, 중상모략과 스텝 평원의 전투를 망라하는 거대한 소용돌이를 일으키는 인물이 되어 있었습니다. 뒤이어 그는 시베리아 도시 치타에서 아타만 세묘노프가 이끄는 백군 장군들에게 추대되어 왕관을 쓰기에 이르렀습니다. (그의 부모님이 귀천상혼을 했기 때문에 러시아 왕위를 주장할 권한이 없다는 사실은 완전히 무시되었습니다.) 새로 즉위한 차르 미하일 2세는 이제 동부의 한때 동맹이었던 적인 콘스탄틴 로자예프스키의 파시스트 군벌과 북부의 적군 군벌들, 남부의 일본 괴뢰정부들과 서부의 소비에트 독재자의 후계국가 사이에 끼어 있습니다. 말할 필요도 없이, 지금 처한 상황이 최선의 상태는 아닙니다. 하지만 그는 이 힘든 상황을 헤쳐나가기로 굳게 마음을 먹었으며, 가령 장군들이 그에게 뭔가 결심하도록 만든 것이 있다면 그것 뿐입니다."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SHEPUNOV_DESC:0 "보리스 니콜라예비치 셰푸노프는 타협을 모르는 남자입니다.\n\n엄격한 볼셰비키 반대파였던 그는 적백내전 중 그리고리 세묘노프와 싸우고 위대한 아타만의 평생 동료이자 제자가 되었고 트란스바이칼 함락 후 하얼빈으로 망명했습니다.\n\n하얼빈에서 백군에 대한 물자 및 정치적 후원자를 찾다가 일본이 지지하는 러시아 망명부서의 직책을 수락하면서 일본의 이익에 긴밀하게 협력하기 시작했습니다. 거기서 그는 소비에트 연방에 버금갈 훈련 과정 조직에 기여했고, 소련을 물리치는데 도움이 될 만한걸 찾고자 희망했습니다.\n\n연방이 무너지고 2차 세계대전에서 독일과 추축국이 승리하면서 그는 기회가 왔다고 생각했습니다. 얼마 지나지 않아 세묘노프 및 옛 제자들과 함께 로마노프 왕자를 하얼빈으로 유인하기 위한 음모를 꾸몄습니다. 음모가 성공하고 미하일 2세를 극동의 '꼭두각시 차르'로 옹립한 것은 백군의 대의를 정당화 하는데 많은 기여를 했지만, 파시스트와의 동맹이 무너지면서 영광스러운 전진에 대한 꿈은 산산조각나버렸고, 그저그런 러시아 군벌에 지나지 않았습니다.\n\n그러나 극동이 통합되고 아타만이 죽으면서 마침내 그는 동시베리아에서 가장 중요한 군 인사가 될 수 있었고, 미하일에게 힘을 실어주려는 충성파의 음모가 무너지면서 정치력도 확보하게 되었습니다.\n\n제국의 꿈을 되살리기 위해선 또 다른 인물이 필요하다는걸 알고 있지만, 일단은 섭정 통치에 만족하고 있습니다. 셰푸노프는 그를 과소평가하고 무시한 사람들에게 그 행동이 얼마나 어리석었는지 가르쳐주고 있습니다."

 POLITICS_NIKITA_ROMANOV_DESC:0 "니키타 알렉산드로비치 로마노프, 미하일 2세의 삼촌이자 모든 러시아인의 차르는 니키타 1세로 옹립된 꼭두각시입니다.\n\n그는 이 사실을 알고 있습니다. 장관들도 알고 있습니다. 끈을 단단히 쥐고있는 장군들은 가장 확실히 알고 있습니다.\n\n그럼에도 불구하고 그는 만족합니다. 옛 제국의 쇠퇴기에 태어난 그는 젊은 시절 간신히 친척들과 같은 운명을 모면할 수 있었고 이를 잘 기억하고 있습니다. 처음에 파리에 정착한 그는 옥스퍼드에서 계속 교육을 받았고, 결혼해서 아이를 낳고 가능한 한 최선을 다해 삶을 살았습니다. 그러나 단 한번도 가문의 땅을 잊지 않았고, 1920년대와 30년대 동안 망명 왕족 사회에서 매우 활발히 활동했습니다. 제 2차 세계대전 당시 처음엔 소련의 붕괴를 기쁘게 지켜봤지만, 국가판무관부가 설치되고 뒤이어 군벌 간 잔혹한 내전이 벌어지면서 러시아의 군주주의는 사라졌다고 확신했습니다.\n\n하지만 이후 치타의 초대를 받았습니다. 옛 백군 장교들이 조카 미하일을 '차르'로 옹립했다는 소식을 듣고 온가족을 이끌고 냉혹한 시베리아 도시로 날아가 정치적 임명을 희망했습니다. 그곳에서 그는 두 가지를 발견했습니다. 하나는 실망이고, 다른 하나는 아타만의 죽음 이후 가장 강력한 보리스 셰푸노프라는 '친구'였습니다. 그러나 미하일이 손을 지나치게 놀리자 모든 것이 바뀌었습니다. 니키타는 구체적인 내용까진 모르지만, 미하일이 호주로 영원히 떠나버렸고 셰푸노프가 그를 차르로 발탁했다는건 알고 있습니다.\n\n사실 니키타는 권력을 갖고 싶어합니다. 그러나 미하일에게 무슨일이 일어났는지 보았습니다. 셰푸노프와 군부에게 서명해주는 것이 러시아에 대한 꿈과 로마노프 권좌를 되찾게 해준다면, 그는 그냥 그렇게 하는것에 만족합니다."

In his early 30's by the time that he was appointed prime minister of the resurgent Russian Empire, Sobchak was formerly the young and quite successful mayor of Chita before being spirited away to his now much more important post.\n\nSobchak's political career had already bloomed during his time in Chita, where he earned a reputation for getting what he wanted - though, unlike many others in Russia, he did so through handshakes, smiles, cordial relations, and back-door dealings. Finding himself on the side of Ivan Mikhailov's anti-army group, he was rewarded soon after with the post of prime minister.

Although Nikolay Alexandrovich entered Petrograd University, he did not graduate because of the outbreak of war with Germany, enrolling in Nikolaev Cavalry School instead. Graduating in 1917, he took part in the war as part of the 5th Uhlan Regiment until 1918, when he joined the war effort of the Whites in the Russian Civil War.\n\nServing initially as a personal adjutant to Colonel Stepanov, commander of White forces in Kazan, Ukhtomsky would go on to participate in battles along the Urals until the end of 1919. By 1920, the fortunes of the war were decisively against the Whites, and Ukhtomsky fled from Krasnoyarsk to Harbin, leaving in 1922 for Germany.\n\nSeven years later, in 1929, he returned to Harbin and began to engage in journalism, in which he heavily opposed the Bolsheviks and communism and called for the restoration of the White movement. These efforts, as well as his aristocratic background and monarchist views, brought him close to Semyonov, and when Semyonov left Harbin to finally begin the restoration of the Tsar, Ukhtomsky went with him to aid his efforts.§!"

 ### General Bios ###
 MILITARY_GRIGORY_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "§LGrigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov, the infamous Ataman of the Transbaikal Cossack Host, has spent nearly his entire life fighting the forces of Bolshevism, and he sees no reason to stop any time soon. Born in Transbaikal, Semyonov was once viewed with some skepticism thanks to his mixed Buryat heritage. After giving a good account of himself in World War 1, Semyonov was sent back to his homeland to put together a division of Buryat volunteers. It wasn't long, however, before he was facing down the barrel of the October Revolution. Semyonov wasted no time rallying his forces for rebellion against the Bolshevik regime, and what followed was years of brutal guerilla warfare against the Red Army in the Far East.\n\nEventually, however, he and his forces were pushed back across the Manchurian border, and Semyonov moved operations to Harbin. It was here he got into contact with countless other White exiles such as Konstantin Rodzaevsky's Russian Fascist Party, and the pro-Japanese "Asano Brigade". When the Soviet Union finally collapsed under the pressure of German invasion, Semyonov and his White allies saw their chance. They lured Mikhail Andreevich to Harbin in the hopes they could use him as a source of legitimacy, and marched beyond the Amur to reclaim what they perceived to be rightfully theirs.\n\nAfter carving out fiefdoms of their own from the carcass of Genrikh Yagoda's crumbling empire, the White factions split along ideological lines. Now Semyonov and his ragtag force of Cossacks and White paramilitaries find themselves isolated in their old stronghold in Chita. The old Ataman still hopes to one day finish his herculean quest to take Russia back from the brink, but his advanced age has begun to creep up on him...§!"

 MILITARY_LEONID_MUSTAFIN_DESC:0 "§LBorn in 1914 near the city of Chita, Leonid Nikolayevich came from the large Mustafin family, which fled to Manchuria in 1922. Unable to receive a regular education due to the relative poverty of his family, he grew up in Changchun and worked from an early age. Joining the ROVS in 1933, Leonid became a surveillance agent for the border police, before becoming a combat instructor, and finally a clerk at BREM.\n\nJoining the army of Manchukuo in 1938, he quickly became a sergeant-major of a communications unit, and graduated from a course to become a commissioned officer in 1943. Training with Cossacks in that same year, he was made a platoon commander and then an adjutant, finally becoming a Lieutenant in 1944 and earning a position as a headquarters clerk. His final promotion in the army of Manchukuo was to Major, and over the course of his service he received several awards from his superiors.\n\nSeen as wiser than his older brother, he is not as devoted to Shepunov as Vissarion, although he respects him and served as an enforcer in his security forces back in Harbin. When Shepunov followed Semyonov to retake Russia and restore the Tsar, Leonid dutifully followed.§!"

 MILITARY_VISSARION_MUSTAFIN_DESC:0 "§LBorn in 1910 near the city of Irkutsk, Vissarion Nikolayevich came from the large Mustafin family, which fled to Manchuria in 1922. Unable to receive a regular education due to the relative poverty of his family, he grew up in Changchun and began to work as a teenager, first at an arms factory in Mukden, then a gas station, and finally as a border police officer before at last finding employment at BREM.\n\nAfter receiving some education he joined the army of Manchukuo and became a sergeant-major before graduating from a course to become a commissioned officer, eventually becoming a Major and receiving several awards from the government of Manchukuo.\n\nA protege of Shepunov since the early 30s, he was one of the first to serve in his security force, acting as Shepunov's much feared chief enforcer, causing Vissarion to be viewed by many as dull and violent, especially when compared to his younger brother. When Shepunov chose to follow Semyonov back into Russia, Vissarion was right behind him as always, and has continued serving him in Chita ever since.§!"

 MILITARY_NIKOLAY_KOSSOV_DESC:0 "§LBorn in 1908 in Kiev, Nikolay Borisovich Kossov has had a wildly successful military career. He moved with his family to Manchuria in 1918, in the midst of the Russian Civil War. Growing up in Harbin, he served in the military of the old Fengtian Clique, rising to become an officer even before the overthrow of Zhang Xueliang by the Japanese.\n\nAfter the establishment of Manchukuo, he only became more prominent, becoming head of military transportation in a district of Manchukuo, then chief of the Russian counterintelligence unit of the 4th army of Manchukuo, before finally helping lead a cavalry division into the battles of Khalkhin Gol, after which he became a member of the general staff. Becoming a leading officer at the headquarters of the 4th military district, he received a promotion to Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nDuring the Second World War, he also became the chief military instructor of Russian emigrants in Harbin, and received his final promotion in the army of Manchukuo in 1945, to Colonel. When Semyonov at last left to reclaim Russia, Kossov was one of the many who followed. During his time in Harbin, Kossov mastered several languages in addition to Russian, including English, German, Chinese, and Japanese.\n\nHe is known for being generally supportive of Japanese interests and has many useful connections over in Manchuria, though this causes him to be distrusted by some.§!"
 
 MILITARY_DMITRY_VOLKOGONOV_DESC:0 "§LDmitry Antonovich Volkogonov is a rather young general within the White Army. Hailing from the city of Chita itself, he's long stood as an outlier in the White Army's officer corps - a leader of more "liberal" officers, compared to some hardliners like Shepunov, Volkogonov has spent the past few years cultivating a grassroots informal organization of younger officers within the city of Chita with the goal of liberalizing the empire.\n\nDynamic and impassioned in his quest to end the de facto stratocracy that Semyonov and his successors had imposed on the monarchy-in-exile, Volkogonov has harboured a quiet and simmering resentment towards Shepunov and his stooges for quite some time. Regardless of the direction of the empire, Volkogonov has an interesting career ahead of him.§!"

 WCH_uneasy_figurhead_desc:0 "All hail Tsar Mikhail II, Emperor and Autocrat of all the Russias by the Grace of God! Many praises ring out in Chita for the Puppet Tsar, but the reality of the situation is very different. Essentially kidnapped and forced to assume the throne amidst bickering and aging White Army officer cliques, Mikhail wishes for little more than to see his home again, far away from Russia."
 WCH_sunset_of_white_chivalry:0 "백군 기사도의 일몰"
 WCH_sunset_of_white_chivalry_desc:0 "Much of the state's military leadership consists of aging White Army generals more concerned with past glories than addressing the situation at hand. Many of them are not long for the world, and the illiberal nature of the government makes attracting younger and more innovative replacements difficult."
 WCH_white_army_leadership:0 "백군 지도부"
 WCH_white_army_leadership_desc:0 "The leadership conflict was solved; the Tsar can worry about taking charge once we finally reclaim the Motherland. Until then, leadership will be vested in the hands of the Army who, unimpeded by the Tsar's interference, will dedicate their energies to the aforementioned restoration."
 WCH_tsarist_leadership:0 "차르주의 지도부"
 WCH_tsarist_leadership_desc:0 "Our leadership conflict was settled at long last: the Army generals have been put back in their place as servants and advisors of the Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias. No longer will vested interests within the Army leadership interfere with our goal of restoration; we are united at last in the person of the Tsar."
 WCH_manchurian_aid:0 "만주 산업 원조"
 WCH_imperial_prospector_corps:0 "제국 탐사대"
 WCH_imperial_prospector_corps_desc:0 "Siberia is a cruel mistress. Thick, freezing cold forests and miles upon miles of sprawling, uncharted land. Not to mention the even more hellish climate up north. But, Siberia is also filled with untapped ores. Thus, the Imperial Prospector Corps braves these climates in search of these minerals, blazing trails through the east and taming the wild beast that she is."
 WCH_imperial_development_company:0 "제국 개발 회사"
 WCH_imperial_development_company_desc:0 "The Imperial Development Company is a state-run corporation tasked with the clearance of land area in the harsh Siberian wilderness, and the development of infrastructure and public works across our prospective empire. Thanks to generous "investments" out of our Tsar's pockets, the IDC has wasted no time transforming the wasteland into something more usable."
 WCH_specialist_training_idea:0 "전문적 훈련"
 WCH_specialist_training_idea_desc:0 "The focus on specialist training for the state's military is having a marked effect, as ordinary soldiers are responding effectively in situations that ordinary drills could not have prepared them for. This individual investment in every soldier isn't sustainable in the long-term won't be able to keep this up forever, but for now the state's soldiers are, individually, some of the best in all of Russia."
 WCH_far_easts_finest:0 "극동 최고의"
 WCH_far_easts_finest_desc:0 "The continued focus on military advancement has permanently transformed the state's military into the finest force in Siberia, if not all of Russia proper. Other nations look upon the state's soldiers with envy and more than a little fear, dreading the prospect of having to face The Far East's Finest."
 WCH_atamans_legacy:0 "아타만의 유산"
 WCH_atamans_legacy_desc:0 "Ataman Semyonov was many things. He was an organizer. A politician. A visionary. But, above all else, he was a general, eternally focused on the battlefield success of the White movement. The Ataman himself may be gone, but his militaristic legacy to the state is not. Solders! Take heed, for the Ataman is watching from far above!"
 WCH_northern_war:0 "북방전쟁"
 WCH_northern_war_desc:0 "This war against the mad preacher of Omolon is different from anything our state has faced before. Peasant uprisings, fanatical priests, and threats of damnation sap the strength of formations in the field. But they will be driven back in the name of the Tsar, and the state will establish control over the vast Siberian interior to make sure no such uprising can ever occur again. Ura!"
 WCH_base_economic_bonus_civilian_bias:0 "민간 조정 예산"
 WCH_base_economic_bonus_military_bias:0 "군사 조정 예산"
 WCH_base_economic_bonus_military_bias_desc:0 "The decision has been made - the state's budget will allocate all possible funding to the military in order to ensure we have the strength needed to unite the region. The guns, trucks, artillery pieces, and ammunition the budget will secure will ensure that we can not only defend ourselves against our enemies, but also take the fight to them."

 WCH_imperial_development_company_regional_desc:0 "An entity wholly concerned with improving the industrial base of the Far East, the Imperial Development Company operates as a massive state-subsidized enterprise, bringing infrastructure and industrial expansion to previously undeveloped and underdeveloped areas of the state."
 WCH_imperial_governing_committee_civilian:0 "제국 통치 위원회"
 WCH_imperial_governing_committee_civilian_desc:0 "Russia is vast, and our territory within it is getting vaster as more and more provinces fall under our territory. The Imperial Governing Committee is a fundamental tool for assisting the administration of the provinces of our burgeoning empire. Staffed mostly with civilian leaders, it is decidedly a force for the people of Russia."
 WCH_imperial_governing_committee_military:0 "제국 통치 위원회"
 WCH_imperial_governing_committee_military_desc:0 "The Imperial Governing Committee, a political structure tasked with oversight of the state's vast and near-autonomous territories, has been dominated by military interests. It therefore acts to promote the expansion of military infrastructure within its jurisdiction. Which is almost everywhere."
 WCH_land_grants_civilian:0 "제국 토지 교부금"
 WCH_land_grants_civilian_desc:0 "The Imperial Government committee has at last decided what to do with all the provinces without leadership, filling their governments with competent leaders. For the sake of honesty towards the people, these politicians have been plucked from the civilian administration."
 WCH_land_grants_military:0 "제국 토지 교부금"
 WCH_land_grants_military_desc:0 "The state has decided to dedicate significant tracts of land for the exclusive use of the military. This allows for the establishment of centralized supply and recruitment operations."
 WCH_japanese_efficiency:0 "일본의 효율성"
 WCH_japanese_efficiency_desc:0 "The industrial base of the state has been extensively studied and optimized by Japanese experts. Using the lessons imparted, national industries have achieved a level of efficiency and production previously only dreamed about."
 WCH_zaibatsu_dominated_economy:0 "자이바츠가 지배하는 경제"
 WCH_zaibatsu_dominated_economy_desc:0 "Japanese zaibatsu, originally allowed into the state economy in order to promote modernization and development, have managed to secure a sufficiently commanding position so as to effectively control the entire economy. While there are benefits to this, it does mean that the state must be extremely careful with regards to anything that could hurt Japanese relations."
 WCH_imperial_corporations_idea:0 "제국 기업"
 WCH_imperial_corporations_idea_desc:0 "In imitation of the colossal Japanese Zaibatsu, the state has sponsored the establishment of Imperial Corporations.

 WCH_the_true_heirs_of_harbin:0 "하얼빈의 진정한 후계자"
 WCH_the_true_heirs_of_harbin_desc:0 "10월 혁명 당시 알렉산드르 케렌스키의 불법 정부를 뒤엎은 볼셰비키는 러시아를 혼란 속에 던저넣었습니다. 우리를 포함한 백군은 몇 년 동안 용맹하게 맞서 싸웠지만 후퇴할 수 밖에 없었습니다. 차르정 부활이라는 신념을 계속 유지하던 우리는 만주에 있는 도시인 하얼빈으로 이동해 망명정부를 설립하고 러시아 파시스트당과 믿기 힘든 (하지만 필요한) 동맹을 맺었습니다.\n\n소비에트 연방이 나치의 맹공에 무너졌을 때 우리는 기회를 잡았습니다. 우리는 차르 미하일 2세와 함께 적법한 위치를 되찾기 위해 행동했습니다. 하지만 파시스트가 우리를 배신했습니다. 놈들은 우리의 진군을 막고 우리 영토를 조각냈습니다. 놈들은 정통성을 주장하지만 실제로는 없습니다. 어머니 러시아의 진정한 애국자들은 그리고리 세묘노프와 그의 항상 충성스러운 장군들과 함께 놈들을 물리치고 우리가 하얼빈의 진정한 후계자라는 것을 증명해낼 것입니다."

 WCH_civilian_investments:0 "The Tsar's Investments"
 WCH_civilian_investments_desc:0 "What is an empire without a military? And what is a military without a civilian industry to act as its support, producing anything and everything, from combat rations to supplies needed for logistical support and beyond. Our empire will eventually span the entirety of Russia, and right now we will need to ensure that a precedent is set for the establishment of the Tsar's investments into domestic, civilian industries - not just to support our ever-hungry military, of course, but to guarantee that our state will not repeat the mistakes of the past and ensure that every Russian - from the wealthiest residents of our glittering cities to the poorest of the villages - are taken care of and given the opportunity to earn luxury."

 WCH_mining_knowledge:0 "Siberian Resources"
 WCH_mining_knowledge_desc:0 "Siberia is so frequently portrayed as a vast, unsettled wilderness, covered in marshy swamps and frozen tundras. While this assessment isn't inherently false - it tends to obscure the material value of the land that we currently occupy. Its value isn't what's on top of the earth that we stand on - but instead what's underneath. The region has a large amount of resources that we can exploit, such as silver and copper, for both personal use and export.\n\nMost importantly, however, the paramount resource that any Siberian statelet could covet - coal. Coal is used to power our hungry factories, allowing them to consistently pump out the goods that we need to survive and thrive. We need to invest in the extraction of these resources for the benefit of our state and our economy."

 WCH_Military_investments:0 "The Military's Addendum"
 WCH_Military_investments_desc:0 "No empire is formed, and no empire endures, without a strong military. Without us. Ataman Semyonov, having led us on the long journey to Chita, understands this implicitly. But we find ourselves weakened by budget cuts imposed upon us by the civilians. This is intolerable. Dangerous.\n\nWe have submitted an addendum to the budget currently under review which, if accepted, will ensure that we get the resources we need to prepare for the fights ahead. All we need to do is meet with the Tsar and convince him of the addendum's importance. Without it, the state will not endure."

 WCH_import_industrial_expertise:0 "Contact the Reform Bureaucrats"
 WCH_import_industrial_expertise_desc:0 "It's the sad truth that our industrial body is severely lacking in any sort of expertise or veterancy. Any technical or industrial experts that Chita once harboured were either killed in the decades of strife or fled, apparently anywhere but here. But without those well-versed in industrial management and development, how will we be able to ensure an effective and efficient development of our industry? Clearly, outside help is needed. Many of the White officials, despite residing in Chita, still have significant connections in Harbin and, by extension, Manchuria as a whole. It may be best for us to contact Manchuria's reform bureaucrats - those who had been put in charge of the miraculous industrialization of their state - to see if they have any resources or manpower to spare. Sure, there may be a cost in acquiring their expertise, but surely it's worth it."

 WCH_connecting_chita:0 "The Imperial Transport Commission"
 WCH_connecting_chita_desc:0 "Siberia is, to put it lightly, vast and ill-connected. For many of our soldiers, weeks-long marches are required to get from one place to another, and it's often worse for the peasantry living in the towns and villages within our domain. The economic inefficiencies caused by the logistical issues presented to our administration are simply unacceptable, especially in light of the conflicts that lay just beyond the horizon. We must found the Imperial Transport Commission, headed by the most experienced of our White émigré friends of course, which will be tasked with the connecting of all the towns and major villages within our statelet."

 WCH_industrial_machinery_deal:0 "Import Industrial Machinery"
 WCH_industrial_machinery_deal_desc:0 "Our industrial equipment is, to put it diplomatically, terrible. Other, more couth members of our administration have said even truer things about its state. The reality is that most of the equipment that we have in our factories is inherited from the Soviets, and almost all of it is decrepit at best and completely unusable at worst. But you can't make new machines without, well, working machines.\n\nAnd so, we must begin to search for ways to import industrial machinery, for the sole purpose of kick starting our own domestic and civilian sectors - perhaps our old friends in Manchuria can help out. This will not only ensure that we have an operable industrial economy going forward, but that our factories will be able to effectively churn out weaponry and supplies for our soldiers."

 WCH_examining_the_force:0 "The Officers' Requests"
 WCH_examining_the_force_desc:0 "Any good military needs a well-motivated officer corps. We can promise them glory for the future, but for the moment we need to promise them money. They are woefully underpaid and underequipped, but those they lead are much worse off. They are requesting funds - not to line their own pockets but to provide proper equipment to those they command.\n\nTheir requests are noble and just, and surely the Tsar cannot but see the wisdom in ensuring that his loyal soldiers are properly equipped before they bravely face his many enemies. Consequently, funds for this purpose will be added to our budgetary requests."

 WCH_examine_our_artillery:0 "A Modern Artillery Corps"
 WCH_examine_our_artillery_desc:0 "Two world wars have conclusively proven the superiority of artillery on the battlefield as a significant force multiplier, and this is one of the few principles that our older and younger officers both agree upon.\n\nHowever, the artillery we possess is both few in number and antique in manufacture. It may be expensive, but if we invest in a new and modern artillery corps, using our own customized designs and organization, we can ensure that we have the best artillery in Siberia!"

 WCH_new_infrastructure:0 "The Imperial Prospector Corps"
 WCH_new_infrastructure_desc:0 "More copper, more iron, more coal... more, more more! The current production quotas aren't nearly enough to keep up with the rapid - no, exponential - industrial growth that we're witnessing. Without the resources to support the massive increase of factories that we're looking at, well... perish the thought. Mikhail, at the behest of the brightest economists of Chita, has declared the formation of the Imperial Prospector Corps, an organization that will be dedicated to the searching out of mineral deposits within our borders and begin their exploitation. Progress comes at a cost, certainly, and the IPC is well aware of that. But in a place as wild as Siberia, Mother Nature can take a backseat to progress in order to ensure the prosperity of the Tsar's subjects."

 WCH_public_works_company:0 "The Imperial Development Company"
 WCH_public_works_company_desc:0 "In the darkest days of the anarchy that reigned in Siberia following the concrete establishment of our state centered in Chita, unemployment was rampant and many turned into transient workers, often without a home. While things are looking brighter now than they were then, our civilian sector is still suffering.\n\nThus, a number of our prominent economists have proposed founding an Imperial Development Company, a state-run corporation that is put in charge of and sponsors public works projects - organizing them to give people employment and further develop our crippled civilian industry. The reorganization of our civilian sector is paramount to ensure that our state has a functioning economy during the wars of reunification that are ahead."

 WCH_industrialization:0 "An Industrial Empire"
 WCH_industrialization_desc:0 "With no shortage of assistance from the Imperial Development Company and the Imperial Transport Commission, the industry of Chita, the heart of the White Movement, has gone from terminal to roaring in the matter of months, it seems. As our industry and output get stronger, we continue to construct more factories in an ever-increasing cycle of industrialization.\n\nBut we shouldn't stop here - this industrial growth is only a small step towards our goal - a fully industrialized state spanning from the Pacific to the Baltic. Nonetheless, the models for growth that we have constructed and tested in the area of Chita, and their general success, will act as examples for what we can do in the future. But for now: there is no rest for the brave worker."

 WCH_war_resources:0 "Strategic Resources Extraction"
 WCH_war_resources_desc:0 "While the industrial equipment that we received from Manchuria and abroad helped revive our civilian industry and allowed us to actually operate the factories that we currently possess, sadly, it's not enough for us to expand our resource extraction campaigns. The Imperial Development Company, as effective as it has been so far, seems to be a bottomless pit of demanding further resource allocation to ensure a continued development schedule, and one of the most pressing demands that their administration has come to us with is the implementation of further resource extraction. Thus, we must take on a domestic effort to improve our industrial equipment, as it has now become possible, so that we can take full advantage of the natural resources afforded to us by the bounty of Siberia!"

 WCH_reclamation_act:0 "The Reclamation Act"
 WCH_reclamation_act_desc:0 "Our small enclave has many things - an ever-dedicated officer corps, the best troops that can be conscripted, and factories that belch out refined, industrial goods day in and out. What we are lacking, however, is usable, arable land. Sadly, apart from the city of Chita and a few other mentionable towns and villages, most of the land that is controlled by the Emperor of All Russia and his administration is completely unusable.\n\nVast tracts of marshes and forests so thick that a man could barely pass through the trees. After a wise suggestion whispered into the ear of the Tsar himself, Mikhail II has declared the implementation of the Reclamation Act, a law that puts the Imperial Development Company in charge of clearing unusable land to transform it into tracts of earth that could be used for anything from low-yield farming to training grounds for our troops. Anything's better than the squalid backwaters that the IDC has been tasked with clearing."

 WCH_importing_rifles:0 "Import Japanese Surplus"
 WCH_importing_rifles_desc:0 "The Tsar is told that our industry, fledgling as it may be, works day and night to produce the best equipment for our soldiers. This is a polite fiction. In truth, we do not have the capacity to produce enough rifles, cannons, ammunition for the soldiers we have, let alone those we want to recruit.\n\nDuring the years we spent in Harbin, we made excellent use of equipment given to us by the Japanese. Manchukuo is just across the Argun, and we still have many connections there. Importing a small amount of the vast stockpiles of Japanese arms scattered around the country should prove a simple task."

 WCH_artillery_imports:0 "Support Artillery Investments"
 WCH_artillery_imports_desc:0 "Our officers' plan to modernize our artillery is close to fruition. Working together, our older and younger officers have rapidly developed a detailed plan to completely overhaul our army's artillery in both doctrine and design. All that's left is to obtain the Tsar's approval.\n\nTsar Mikhail knows how critical the military is, and how much we've done, how much blood we've shed, for him. He won't refuse us. He can't."

 WCH_specialist_training:0 "Specialist Training"
 WCH_specialist_training_desc:0 "Modern warfare is dominated by the specialist - the soldier who both trained in and experienced with tasks that no ordinary soldier would be capable of. We are surrounded by enemies, but the Tsar can be assured that our triumph can be guaranteed by transforming our soldiers into an army of specialists.\n\nTraining relating to command decentralization, behind-the-lines operation, sabotage, and much more will be worked into our soldiers' regular training regimens. In this way, we can say that we will never be caught unprepared."

 WCH_the_Far_East_Finest:0 "The Far East's Finest"
 WCH_the_Far_East_Finest_desc:0 "Our military is Siberian, and very few of our soldiers and younger officers have spent time west of the Urals. But this is a strength - if they can survive and thrive here, of all places, they can do so anywhere!\n\nIf we incorporate their knowledge and values into our standard training, we can transform our collection of conscripts, émigrés, and vagrants into the Far East's Finest, a disciplined force seemingly invulnerable to the cold and capable of remaining organized in even the worst of weather. The Tsar wouldn't want it any other way, we're sure of it."

 WCH_the_Tsars_own_division:0 "Imperial Guard Divisions"
 WCH_the_Tsars_own_division_desc:0 "Colloquially, our army is often referred to as 'The Tsar's Finest,' a nickname intended to give pride to the many peasant conscripts making up our forces. But some officers have proposed making the nickname a reality, concentrating a handpicked group of the most loyal, most experienced, and most physically fit soldiers together in specialized units.\n\nThe old Tsars had their Imperial Guard, elite infantry that could not only handle any task but also inspire others to greatness.

A number of mercenary companies were hired, and while we did best them in battle, they're now stuck in frigid Siberia, with no master and no money. This situation presents both a danger and an opportunity - leaving them unemployed could result in disaster, a full-on revolt of professional soldiers that we simply cannot afford at the moment.

The republic, apart from being an anti-monarchist state, controls incredibly valuable land, ripe for material exploitation. Securing their territory would go a long way to ensure a steady export of valuable minerals, as well as an additional place to use to increase our manpower.

Luckily, we have something the Yakuts don't: access to urban centers with populations of the listless unemployed and political prisoners.

If we were to assemble a group of prominent Yakut leaders, both those who were a part of the republic and those who had been marginalized by it, we could offer them political autonomy in exchange for massive economic concessions and the recognition of Mikhail II as the Tsar.

The White officers, with Mikhail's tacit approval, have announced a week of joyous commemoration and the creation of an annual holiday to celebrate the first major step towards the unification of all Russia under the banner of our cause. Great military parades and the banners of Holy Russia have already been prepared and meticulously planned, and victory ceremonies have begun. The Tsar himself seemed present but notably distracted at a number of the meetings about these ceremonies, though, apparently only barely paying attention. Perhaps it is time that we sat down with him and discussed our future together."

However, unless we take decisive and focused action, there is no guarantee we can secure that control.\n\nThis is the start of something special - something that we've worked towards for a long time. But we cannot rest. There is much to do. We need to establish administration to remote areas of our territory, eliminate internal resistance, and settle the increasing tensions between factions in both our government and military."

The sheer expanses that we're now responsible for are, to put it kindly, incredibly hard to administer. However, this shouldn't stop us - if the Bolsheviks could do it, we can too.\n\nA comprehensive plan has been put forward by some of the more economically-minded members who followed us from Harbin. An extensive series of delegated provinces, each one of them relatively autonomous, with local militias ultimately subservient to the central government will divide our land and ensure that we're able to govern, extract resources, and defeat the few ideological hardliners who have not yet given up."

The IGC would answer directly to us, but would take a considerable strain off our already-overloaded ministers.\n\nThis IGC is as they'd say a "no-brainer". However, there has been some debate over how to exactly implement this committee.

Some outstanding earmarks in prior discussions, including the nature of taxation and where the military can be housed, whether billets or barracks, and seemingly dozens of other footnotes now can be dealt with.

A group of younger officers have proposed an "interior pacification" organization which the top brass has run with and restructured into what is essentially a secret police.\n\nThis organization, known as the Imperial Department for Order and Security, or the IDOS, will be the ones primarily responsible for dealing with these insurgencies and their fallout.

Mikhail was born in France and spent his life just about everywhere but Russia. When he was kidnapped and brought to the city of Chita as a prisoner in all but name, he was forced to read speeches phonetically, frequently not even aware of what he was saying.

This was where he ruled, this was his domain.\n\nThough currently, not entirely, thanks to Semyonov and Shepunov and their ilk. More and more, they overruled his decisions and took over his portfolio. He supposed he had never gotten along too well with the general staff, but they were going too far. Somebody needed to put a stop to their control over the government, and Mikhailov knew exactly who that somebody would be.\n\nHimself, of course.\n\nIf he couldn't convince Semyonov to loosen his grip, then he might have to resort to more drastic measures. Some freedom would do the people of Chita good, just as it did the economy. Even if his plans for a free economy kept making things worse, if the slander spread by other economists was to be believed.\n\nNo matter.

The accursed fascists to the east, the thrice damned bolsheviks to the west, two sides of the same hated coin, both seeking to bring down the legitimate government in Chita. There were countless internal troubles too; a pathetic Tsar, unending unrest, and a seemingly eternal lack of funds. On top of all this, he had already figured that Semyonov was one foot in the grave. It was becoming a real mess of problems.\n\nHowever, it was his mess to resolve, and he would bring down anyone who disagreed with that.\n\nEven in the unlikely event that it meant facing the Tsar himself.\n\nOnce the dominance of the White Army, and himself by extension, was secured, and the unrest suppressed, order would surely follow the long arm of Imperial law across the Far East. Only then would peace begin to come to Russia.\n\nThen, as the twin evils of fascism and bolshevism fell to the ground like coins, Shepunov would watch, just as he had with the fascists all those years back in Harbin.

However, while some men would take a break after dealing with as much as Volkogonov had been assigned, he simply moved on to the next stack of papers without hesitation.\n\nHe knew he was being assigned all this paperwork because the old generals did not like him, and made very little effort to hide it, but that did not slow Volkogonov down in the slightest. When presented with such difficulties, he would simply have to succeed beyond all expectations. If he kept overperforming, one day somebody would have to take notice. The only real problem he faced was...\n\nA young officer under his command opened his door and saluted, making Volkogonov look up. Immediately, he felt like he knew what this was about, and developed a sense of dread. "Sir! An officer got into a fight with a civilian while drunk. He's from your command, so his punishment is for you to decide."\n\nLetting out a long sigh, Volkogonov stood up and walked towards the officer. He didn't know if he was sighing in relief that it hadn't been as bad as he had expected, or exasperation that this was the third incident involving tensions between the soldiers and civilians this week. He just wished that the army, and generals like Semyonov and Shepunov in particular, would come to its senses and realize they were meant to help people, not hurt them. "Very well. Lead the way."\n\nThe officer frowned and looked at Volkogonov strangely. "Sir, permission to speak freely?" At Volkogonov's slight nod, he continued. "Have you been sleeping well?

He lost track of the number of times somebody on the street waved to him and called his name, or cheered him on enthusiastically, if a bit loudly. His last campaign for the mayoral office had really gotten people fired up- then again, people all across Russia were fired up, desperate for any improvement to their lives whatsoever. He did hope to improve as many lives as he could, though certain... individuals made that task much more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nA squadron of soldiers came towards him, their rifles slung over their backs. Speak of shit and it comes, Sobchak supposed. "You are Mayor Sobchak?" The soldier closest to him asked, his question at least sounding genuine; Sobchak supposed that even though he was popular among the people, with the way things were, soldiers had much more importany figures to learn the names of.\n\n"That would be me," Sobchak answered pleasantly. "Is something the matter?" The soldier did not answer, instead shoving a piece of paper towards Sobchak that he had not noticed before. Frowning, he read the paper carefully, his eyes widening more the more he read. "Tax increase? Another one?" He asked, sounding incredulous.\n\n"Sorry." The soldier said insincerely, sounding almost bored, before turning and signalling for his squadron to leave. Sobchak kept switching between looking up at their retreating backs and down at the paper. Did they think him some kind of messenger, meant to give people bad news on their behalf? And a tax increase in these conditions was simply cruel, with people struggling to survive as is. Somebody had to put an end to this behavior, and soon."

 WCH.30.desc:0 ""You asked to see me, sir?" General Shepunov asked, standing face-to-face with his superior in the doorway. The old Ataman, who leaned on an intricately designed cane, looked as though he had one foot in the grave. The years had clearly not been kind to the man who once defied the Red behemoth so many years ago.\n\n"Indeed. Please, come in and take a seat." Ataman Semyonov said weakly, his voice almost a whisper. Shepunov did as he said and took position on a dusty, vintage sofa by the fireplace. The old man took longer, bones audibly creaking as he sat across from his protege. "Boris, I'll get right to the point. I don't have nearly as much time to waste on platitudes these days." Semyonov ended off with a chuckle which quickly transformed into a messy cough.\n\n"That makes two of us, Grigoriy. Just tell me what you need of me."\n\n"Boris, my time here is running out. It shames me deeply that I won't be able to see Russia cleansed of the red menace in my lifetime, but perhaps I can rest more peacefully knowing that the struggle will continue without me." Semyonov leaned forward. "When the time comes, I want you to take my place."\n\nShepunov was speechless. He had long followed in Semyonov's footsteps, but to take his place? "Grigoriy, I would be honored, but, are you absolutely sure that I'm the one you want?"\n\n"I've had decades to think it over, Boris. Nobody truly understands what this movement means like you and I do. If anyone can bring order back to our sacred motherland, it is you."

And yet he had been a known quality.\n\nMikhail had known where he stood. He could not yet say the same of Semyonov's replacement, both as interim Prime Minister and as Commander-in-Chief of the military as a whole, Boris Shepunov. He knew of the general of course, Semyonov's long-serving protegé, and had interacted with him before, but never in such a political capacity.\n\nShepunov had spoken grandly at Semyonov's funeral, eulogizing the man and proclaiming his greatness, no-doubt already knowing that he would be stepping forward to fill the power vacuum. Mikhail was sure that he had equally grand plans. The White Army always did, especially when they involved him.\n\nWhich was why, on this very day when he formally 'invited' Shepunov to take control over the government, he had to fight hard to keep his expression neutral. The man's entire demeanor was entirely different. He walked differently. Spoke differently. His eyes even seemed to have, if possible, gotten even colder than he had remembered.\n\nAs Shepunov thanked him for his 'confidence' and turned to leave, no doubt to execute whatever plans he had already made, Mikhail could no longer prevent a grimace from crossing his face.\n\nWhat was to come?

I shall be taking on all other duties handled by my predecessor, as well. Rest assured that-"\n\n"That's rather swell, Commander Shepunov, but I've been meaning to ask you something for a while now."\n\n"Yes, my Tsar?" Shepunov asked, his face twitching ever so slightly. He despised being interrupted, especially by someone like the human weasel sitting in front of him.\n\n"I was, erm, wondering, hypothetically, what if I didn't, uh, want to stay here? In Russia, I mean."\n\n"What are you saying? You're the Tsar, you cannot leave." Shepunov raised an eyebrow.\n\n"I don't like it here, Shepunov. Please, if you would-"\n\n"Let's make one thing perfectly clear, 'Majesty'. You are going to be staying here in Russia for as long as that crown rests on your head, and I would suggest, strongly, to put to bed any thoughts of abandoning your destiny."

He, the son of a peasant, specifically selected out of thousands - no, tens of thousands - to be a member of the Imperial Guard! Yeltsov, a man who mere years ago had been a private, eating bottom barrel food not fit for a rat, was now the man who would guard his Tsar with his life.\n\nThen, suddenly, the Tsar was there, stepping out on the top of the Palace's tall steps. A newfound energy possessed him, and he wanted to, desperately, yell his loyalty to the man who would be Tsar of all Russia.\n\n"Subjects," began the Tsar, his voice clearly heard by all men in attendance. "I am..."\n\nFor a couple of seconds, there was silence where inspiring words should have been. "...here to say that..."\n\nYeltsov had an instinctual need to see the face of his fellow guards, but knew better than to do that in front of the Tsar. But still, he couldn't be the only one who find this strange.\n\nThe 'speech', if you could call it that, continued for another five minutes, although based off the actual content, Yeltsov guessed it would have been a minute at the most. Occasionally, the Tsar stumbled over his words before correcting himself, clearly embarrassed.\n\nBut the gist was obvious: he, Yeltsov, was a member of the Imperial Guard, tasked with protecting the Emperor with his life.

 WCH.34.desc:0 "The RFP troopers stationed along their border with the Principality west of Magdagachi had grown lax, frequently posting watches only several hundred meters away from their outpost.\n\nThis was not seen by either them or their officers as a significant problem. The neighboring White Army formations could fight well enough, of course, but they rarely attempted special maneuvers. So as the sounds of galloping horses began echoing through the small valley that the outpost rested in, they were at first confused. They then realized, far too late, that the sounds were both too loud, and coming from the wrong direction.\n\nWhen the contingent of White Army cavalry broke out of the treeline, immediately overrunning the too-close pickets and galloping towards the outpost at breakneck speed, the RFP officers tried in vain to prepare a defense. But there just wasn't enough time.\n\nThose few troopers already on duty could not believe their eyes. The cavalry advanced, despite their great speed, in perfect echelon, with no subunits becoming separated or fragmented. As they approached the outpost's perimeter, they expertly divided, with the main force leaping over the poorly-maintained wire obstacles and smaller ones circling around both to flank and prevent escape.\n\nThe result was carnage. Utterly overwhelmed, the cavalrymen slaughtered the RFP, either where they stood, or as they tried to flee in terror from this unexpectedly proficient enemy. When it was all over, both the outpost itself and the intelligence contained within had been secured for minimal casualties.\n\nWhen the cavalry departed back westwards, they burned the outpost to the ground, sending the message that the White Army was no longer as ill-disciplined as the RFP itself often was. It was a real, professional force, with tactics to match.\n\nAs they intended to soon prove in increasing fashion."

Or, just as often, not making them, and arriving anyway. This particular meeting was of the latter variety.\n\nThe general, one of those closest to Semyonov's inner circle, had walked right past his deputies and secretaries, entering Mikhailov's office and closing the door behind him. From his demeanor Mikhailov could tell that, whatever the man wanted, it would not be something he himself would be pleased to grant. And that he would not have a choice besides.\n\nThe request, as he expected, was polite. The military would be 'requesting' further funds to be diverted towards their own initiatives in the upcoming budget. In order to ensure the defense of the state and of the Tsar, of course. The authorization for that diversion to be included was placed in front of him a moment later, with all of the specific amounts and diversions meticulously identified. All it needed was his signature on the bottom line.\n\nUnder the general's stare, Mikhailov knew he would, and did, sign the document. The general whisked it away a moment later, leaving without further word. As the door closed behind the man once again, Mikhailov once again felt the deep frustration that he had grown used to begin to build within him.\n\nThis time, however, it was even stronger than usual. The military had always ensured its own primacy in the Principality's budget. But lately their 'requests' had grown, in both frequency and amount. Very soon, Mikhailov knew, and if the trend continued, he was not sure where the civil government would find funds for projects of any size.\n\nHe also was not sure if the military cared."

When it became further known that the Tsar himself was to open it, they were intrigued, and came out in droves to witness the occasion.\n\nAnd so, when Mikhail did arrive, it was to face a crowd much, much larger than had been anticipated. He wasn't alone, of course. Both Minister of Finance Mikhailov and Mayor Sobchak were present as well, giving their own speeches before his own, but as they spoke his anxiety only increased.\n\nHe might not have wanted to be in Chita in the first place, the figurehead Tsar of a formerly-stateless army, but as long as he was he was determined to put his best foot forward. The only problem, at least as far as speeches were concerned, was his Russian. Or, rather, his lack of any considerable experience at speaking it.\n\nAs Mikhail took to the podium, to what was to him an unexpectedly enthusiastic cheer, he withdrew his speech and began to speak, nervously at first, but with increasing confidence. Until he realized he had missed a word. And then a second one. And then a third. In a sudden panic, it was as if he had forgotten Russian entirely.\n\nThankfully, Mayor Sobchak seemed to have noticed his monarch's distress. Intervening, Sobchak thanked Mikhail for taking the time to address his subjects and, in doing so, allowed him an opportunity to step off of the stage.\n\nAs Mikhail left, personally quite relieved, he was again surprised by the cheers that followed him.

But they were not prepared for what they found that day.\n\nThe fascists, on the verge of total defeat, had abandoned their positions in the night, fleeing in an attempt to save themselves. Advancing past their former defensive line, the unit soon encountered what they at first thought, owing to the wire fence and observation towers, to be a fortified supply depot. The towers abandoned, a small group of volunteers breached the main gate, under close supervision. Shortly thereafter, they returned, their faces white. The rest of the unit soon discovered why.\n\nThe compound was no supply depot. It was, rather, a camp for those that Rodzaevsky's regime had considered undesirables of any sort. Politically, socially, ethnically, religiously, or for any reason at all. The camp's former guards had deserted alongside their compatriots, but they had left their prisoners behind.\n\nThe shells that moved were more skeleton than human, walking around in a daze, and seeming not even to recognize their liberators as men at all. More than one had fled in primal terror at seeing a uniform, regardless of who it belonged to. Two of them died shortly after gorging themselves on food the soldiers had provided, before the unit's medical officers imposed strict rationing.\n\nBut the worst came when a young corporal found the graves, of such scale that, despite their attempts, the fascists had been unable to properly conceal them. Overcome, the corporal found himself vacating the contents of his stomach before swooning, and taking much effort to revive.\n\nThe unit's commander hastily dispatched messages demanding relief.

The regime that controlled the port of Magadan was being pressured by its enemies, and had called for fighters from abroad. Accepting the incentive payment, Ernesto found himself stepping off a boat in that port only several weeks later, to a land very different from those he had been in before.\n\nTruthfully, he did not like the people he worked for, but they paid well and on time, and that was enough. The adventure he had sought was provided as well, and he had found himself quickly learning Russian, very helpful for interacting with the locals and better understanding the shouts of the local soldiers when things got heated.\n\nAnd things had gotten very heated indeed. When he had been hired, his employers had failed to tell him that he would not be fighting insurgents, but rather a real army. The White Army. Which had, in short order, defeated those same employers. Ernesto had survived, however, by strategically deserting when the outcome was obvious. After securing his last paycheck, of course.\n\nAt first Ernesto had thought himself in trouble, but then he heard the good news. The new owners of Magadan needed manpower to secure the territory, and were willing to pay for it.

The procedure went on as planned, as the Emperor made his way down the row exchanging handshakes and salutes. He couldn't help but notice that these young men looked at him with a great deal of admiration, as though he were a figure of divine status. One of the officers he had come to couldn't have been older than twenty.\n\n"Hail, your Imperial Majesty. It is an honor to serve you." The young officer gave a gracious salute.\n\nMikhail sheepishly went in for a handshake. "No, no. The honor is all mine. I am truly grateful for your service." The Tsar gave a slight, nervous smile. He glanced back at Boris Shepunov, who was standing behind him. The old general had his arms crossed, and his impatient expression clearly indicated that he wanted Mikhail to pick up the pace.\n\nAs the inspection concluded and the royal entourage made its way back to their transportation, Mikhail passed by a sight that had caught his eye. A large bronze statue depicting a heroic cossack warrior on horseback was prominently displayed out front of the army base. Mikhail stopped briefly to examine the bronze figure, captivated by the pose of the warrior.

This group mostly consists of wealthy aristocrats and businessmen, and are keen to utilize the Committee to expand their business interests in the empire. Also among this group are close political allies and confidants of Tsar Mikhail II, and control over the Committee would surely mean an expansion of the crown's influence.\n\nOn the other hand, politicians and military men allied to the White Army also seek to bring the IGC under their control. The majority of these men have connections to the White Army's general staff, and by extension, Army Chief of Staff Boris Shepunov.

Kiril wondered if, in the future, there would even be any forests left once the IDC was done?\n\nHe had been born and raised a man of the wilds, living off the land and appreciating what nature had to offer.

After peeking his head out for a quick check of the corridor outside, he shut the door and approached the seated monarch who had been awaiting him for some time. "Are you sure you weren't followed? Did you make double sure?" Mikhail enquired nervously as he drummed his fingers on the table.\n\n"I'm positive. Let's just get this over with, I don't wish to stay here longer than I have to." Mikhailov opened his briefcase and laid several papers from within across the table, each inscribed with a list of names. Clearing his throat as he took a seat across from the Tsar, the Minister continued: "So. Let's get down to business. These are lists of important people we'll need to get into contact with. It's very important you commit these names to memory."\n\n"Who are these people, exactly?" the Tsar mused as he inspected one of the lists.\n\n"Potential allies. If we're going to get rid of Shepunov, we'll need friends. If we can convince some wealthy oligarchs and disgruntled military men to join our cause, we'll be well on the road to breaking the White Army's grip."\n\nMikhail set his paper aside. "Very well, I'll see if I can't negotiate with Shepunov to allow some... harmless private audiences. I suppose he doesn't need to know what goes on in them?"\n\nThe minister gave a devious grin. "Exactly my thinking. You learn rather fast, your Majesty.""

After calling in favors and a few well-placed words, five of the most powerful industrial oligarchs in the Russian Far East now sat before both him and the Tsar. He would have to choose his next words with discretion. "I'm afraid not, my friend. I wanted to discuss... business. I'm well aware that all of you are chafing under the weight of the monstrous budget sink that is the White Army and are looking for solutions, am I correct?"\n\nThere was a pause amongst the oligarchs before one of them cautiously spoke up. "Tell you the truth? I'm sick of it. You have no idea how much this kind of defense spending eats into a man's profits. Nothing we can do about it though, the White Army's word is law around these parts."\n\n"Our goals are aligned, then. His Majesty and I seek to curb the influence of the military and return the Empire to civilian rule. Of course, to make this happen, we'll need friends..."\n\n"I thought you'd never ask. Tell us what you need, and you'll have it. Just make sure we're taken care of once this is all over, alright?" The oligarch's answer was joined by several nods of agreement from his colleagues.\n\nMikhailov glanced at the Tsar, and smiled as he turned his attention back towards the businessmen.

Igor figured it was likely one of those "you'll know it when you see it" scenarios, if nothing else.\n\nResting his cheek against his fist, Igor began to notice something rather peculiar about the Tsar. Babysitting Mikhail was nothing new to him, but this time there was something different about his mannerisms. He seemed energetic and talkative, and Igor could swear this was the first time he ever saw the Tsar laugh with sincerity. It felt... wrong.\n\nThe Tsar was a prisoner, and anybody who was anyone in this rump Empire knew that fact all too well. Mikhail was always a miserable sod, so why did he seem to have pep in his step today, and why did it not feel right?\n\nThe captain was broken out of his racing thoughts as Mikhail approached him, a smile still slathered across his face. "Alright, Igor. Let's get out of here, shall we?"\n\n"Erm, yes, of course, Your Majesty." Rising to accompany the Tsar outside, he couldn't help but notice the energy he had seen in him a minute ago was quite prevalent in his tone of voice as well.

It appears there's been some mix up at the arsenal, at least, that's the excuse they gave..."\n\nThe documents corroborated Kossov's statement. Thousands of rifles, complete with the ammunition, were inexplicably going missing from the depot on-base. He wanted to believe it was in fact a mix up, but his gut told him something else entirely.

Some of you are businessmen who drove this empire's great industry forward even in times of hardship. Some of you are politicians who seek only to represent their constituents to the best of their abilities. A few of you are officers of the White Army, the very same force that once bravely defied the Soviet usurpers so long ago."\n\n"Despite these very stark contrasts between you all, you've all come here united behind a singular purpose: to take back our country from the selfish and corrupt generals who seek to transform this ancient and glorious empire into nothing more than a quasi-fascist stratocracy, with me as their helpless puppet."\n\n"I am speaking, of course, of Prime Minister Boris Shepunov. The man likes to think he has us all in his iron grip, but he will soon discover that he isn't nearly as clever as he thinks he is. Despite our differences, we will fight side-by-side to remove this aspiring tyrant from our midst and continue the journey towards reunification.

Apparently, some very curious individuals have been reported making repeat visits to the Tsar's dacha. I looked into it, and it turns out they're all friends of Ivan Mikhailov."\n\nThe general went silent. The Minister of Finance has long been a pain in his ass, but as of late he'd been eerily calm. Did this news have anything to do with that? What business did he or his Industrialist friends have with Tsar Mikhail anyway, and why didn't any of this feel right?\n\n"...sir? Are you there?"\n\n"Yes. I want you to look into the Mikhailov connection. Find out what he's up to, and figure out what's going on at those meetings. Don't screw this up, Kossov."\n\n"You can count on it, sir." With that, Shepunov put the phone back into place. Finally, he had a solid lead.

At first glance, his weary mind assumed it was a mean-spirited jest made in poor taste, but when reality had set in, the Tsar realized this paper was to set the stage for his life from now on.\n\nUnder this new schedule, the Tsar would effectively go from a caged-in recluse to a ghost. Did they even want him to see the sun again? The implications here were not lost on Mikhail. There was no Bolshevik infiltration, it was merely an excuse to further stow the Tsar away where he could do no harm to the White Army's ambitions.\n\nSetting the letter aside with a sigh, Mikhail felt several emotions running through his mind at once.

The highest quality defenders, worthy of protecting a king, were now sacked by one simple and swift military order.\n\n"Where are my men?" Tsar Mikhail asked Shepunov, with his arms folded in the corner of a private hallway. "I don't recognize these thuggish street conscripts. These weren't the same men who would have taken a bullet for me the past few years!" Shepunov shrugged, and turned away from Mikhail.\n\n"I'm sure you can see the latent threat of Bolshevism in our Realm recently, Tsar. You've seen for yourself all the reports of Bolsheviks in our midst, waiting for their moment to strike back; strike at you. The Guard may have been a reliable ally to you in the past, but they are far too removed from the chain of command, and I fear they are ripe for infiltration by the enemy. You can rest assured that my men are just as capable of defending you as any of the Guard once did."\n\nMikhail sighed, unable to even see Shepunov eye-to-eye. It was impossible that he could have chosen any radicals. All of those men were willing to bleed and die for the Tsar, regardless of what ideology they held. They were good bodyguards, stalwart defenders, and most importantly, potential friends. People he could trust. But just like the backside of Shepunov, attempting to fight this further would be as if Mikhail would punch a brick wall.\n\n"If you insist, I'll keep these men close."\n\n"Not good enough, Tsar.

The iron bars were cold and slick from the buildup of dew, making his task all the more challenging. Mikhail was hardly in shape for this sort of activity, and felt himself straining as he pulled his body further up. After a few agonizing seconds, though, he was finally sat atop the fence. Mikhail took this moment to catch his breath and determine how he was to get down without breaking his legs, but his rapid thoughts were interrupted when a bright light shined on his position. "Oh, there you are! You had us worried sick, Your Majesty!"\n\n"Shit!" he muttered as one of his guards finally came into view, his flashlight still focused on Mikhail's location. Thinking fast, the Tsar leapt from the fence and into the shrubbery below. The landing was hardly pleasant, but adequately cushioned by the foliage. Lifting his head from the bushes, however, Mikhail was immediately met with three more soldiers.\n\nThe guard in front spoke first, and he did not sound amused. "You'd best come along with us, Your Majesty, it's not safe to be out here this late." Mikhail gave a defeated nod, and rose from the bushes to accompany his captors back to the dacha. The journey was silent, and it gave the Tsar time to reflect on his short-lived adventure. There was no escape from this place, and this time they were likely going to make double sure of that."

Civilian governments lead one step closer to Bolshevism and disaster, a tragedy that we do not need to remember again.\n\nEarly this morning, a steel magnate based in Chita who has voiced some incorrect opinions about the Army and Shepunov's administration was seized in his office and arrested as an enemy of the state. Close members of his inner circle of friends and contacts have informed us about his wonderful spiels of slander, dismissal, and cynicism toward our government. He would drink a bit too much and complain about infantrymen harassing him one day, then whisper to a confidant in private about his distrust of Shepunov and his large quotas of steel. The commotion was loud and disruptive, so much so that all work in the office stopped to gaze upon the White Army's commotion.\n\n"It has come to our attention that your boss is a Bolshevik ally and is thus a traitor to the state as well as the security of the Holy Tsar. Therefore, he is being arrested as we speak. Do not attempt to interrupt."\n\nAs the magnate was handcuffed and pushed out of his office, mildly bruised, the only thing people could do in the office and on the streets was either look him dead in the eye or avert the hawkish gazes of the White Army escorting him to prison."

While the air was incredibly tense, the garrison stood firm despite advancing toward the protestors.\n\nSuddenly, a molotov was thrown. Then, the rifles rang out. Volkogonov ordered his men to stop, but at this point the streets were a full-on warzone. Protestors scrambled to flee amidst the firepower of the garrison, with soldiers beating protesters with the butts of their rifles and shooting at those who were fleeing. Cries of passion suddenly turned to terror, and the military soon regained control over the streets. All he could do was watch as his own men and junior officers ignored his orders and began to slaughter the rioters like so many defenseless cattle.

Yet, this was of little concern. The more pressing matter was the fact a member of the government was deeply involved in this protest.\n\n"You're certain it was him? Without a doubt?" The agent nodded, and passed over some photos to Shepunov.\n\n"Yes, sir. I have come to a concrete conclusion that Ivan Mikhailov's associates were largely responsible for the power and size of the protest, at worst giving them lip service for their own support and at best supplying them with small arms and calling back the local police force." Shepunov wasn't surprised, but still hid an expression of horror. If his own appointees were working against him, would they support the Puppet Tsar over the White Army?\n\n"That'll be all. Thank you." Shepunov dismissed the agent, and sighed loudly after the door was closed.

A metallic squealing and scraping brough the eyes of all those gathered to the train tracks that the Cossack camp was established to protect. A train had pulled up outside the camp, a row of flatbed cars stretching behind it. Heavy tarps hid the hulking shapes that squatted atop the beds.\n\n"About time!" shouted Urakov. "Come on, lads, let's unwrap your gifts from the Tsar!" The Cossacks hurried out to the train, and after some tugging and unclasping of buckles, all wore astonished grins.

Only a few years ago and he would be setting out into the wilderness to hunt or forage, but now, there was hardly anything left of the forest he once knew so well.\n\nThe old hunter turned his eyes down, gazing at the vast industrial park which had replaced the wilderness. He'd played a part in that, trading his soul for money, helping destroy the forest which had provided his family for generations. Oh the IDC had paid him handsomely for his services, the money helped him keep his home, allowed him to provide his children the education to ensure that they'd do well in the new Siberia.\n\nHis children were somewhere down there, working in the vast expanse of steel and concrete. Siberia may have been tamed, the wilderness replaced with civilization, but civilization was no place for men like him. His children would never be able to live the life he had, probably for the better, but where others saw progress all he saw was the cost to the wildlife, the forests, and the rivers.\n\nHis glass was empty now, alcohol dulling his mind, filled as it was with regrets and increasingly distant memories. Stumbling onto his feet, the old hunter went back inside. One last untamed beast in a civilized land."

After a short time spent in a Tsarist prison camp, wondering as to his ultimate fate, he had suddenly been issued simple tools and sent to an iron mine near Chita. Long hours spent underground had driven him almost to the point of insanity, and nearly destroyed him physically besides.\n\nJust as suddenly, however, he had been ordered into a truck, and within short order had found himself in a munitions factory. Assembling and polishing artillery shells was hard work, but it was nothing compared to mining. Even if there were many more guards watching him now.\n\nHe supposed he couldn't blame them. Placing former enemies in proximity to high explosives would have given him pause as well. But they had nothing to worry about, at least not from those smart enough to properly understand their situation.\n\nEven if escape or sabotage was possible, there was nowhere to go, and Matkovsky was gone. As stressful as work in the factory was, it was a far sight better than that of the mine. The food and barracks were better as well. So Andrei would work, and work hard. One day, he knew, the Tsarists would have to let him go.\n\nUntil then, however, he would work. Finishing his stretch, he returned his attention to the production line.

He'd get the cliff notes from his staff once they were back in Chita anyways.\n\nTaking in the view of the Songhua river Shepunov took the opportunity to admire the land in which he had spent so many years. Harbin held many memories, few pleasant, but even he could still appreciate the land's natural beauty, what little of it not consumed under the smog from the city's industries.\n\nTurning his attention back to the tour, Shepunov's eye was caught by a peculiar aircraft, it's backward-facing propellor and rear-mounted wings unlike anything else at the airbase. "Excuse me Colonel, but what aircraft is that?" Shepunov asked, interrupting the officer, his eyes still firmly locked on the offending plane.\n\nRecovering, the guide caught Shepunov's gaze and followed it to the culprit. "That is a J7W3 Shinden, an old interceptor built in the last days of the Second World War. I've been told it handles well, but it's over a decade out of date, Sir."

An errant round tore through the portrait of Sablin that stood at the end of the table, the shattering of glass unheard in the rattle of gunfire. The Leninists fought back, firing wildly with pistols and cheap SMGs, crouching behind overturned tables. Others attempted to flee, the last thing they saw before running into the snow were the hollow and betrayed faces of their comrades, who loved them above all others.\n\nThe operation was a tremendous success. Every communist bandit was accounted for, either dead or in the tender clutches of the Okhrana. Blood dripped down onto the fallen portrait.

Now the Japanese delegates whispered among themselves, looking at him and listening in awe of his almost flawless command of Japanese as he continued to lay out the requested terms of the economic agreement.\n\nFascinated by his knowledge of their language, he found them much more agreeable than past negotiators had, and while the deal still favored the Japanese, the terms were fairer than they had been in the past. It was times like these that Kossov found himself glad he had kept practicing his Japanese even after achieving a good level of fluency in the late 30s.

Unfortunately, it seems everyone else in Chita had noticed this fact as well, and ever since the Tsar had woken up they had been hounding him with questions as to what his wardrobe would be. Even some of the generals had been participating in the discussions and debates, much to the Tsar's worry. Was his outfit really such a big deal? The stress of the decision had left the Tsar paralyzed within his bedchamber, a variety of outfits lied out upon his bed.\n\nSome of the generals had argued that a simple, quality suit would show modernity and was more appropriate for the meeting. Others had argued that the Tsar's outfit must display his proper glory, and that a simple suit would make him appear mundane and bland. Mikhail had thought this a fairly accurate portrayal of the Tsar, but they chose to ignore his thoughts on the matter. Maybe Mikhail's wife would know what outfit would work best, but she was still a world away from him. Luckily for Mikhail, his paralysis was resolved by an exasperated Shepunov, who barged into his bedchamber, chose a fairly elaborate outfit, and threw the rest haphazardly into Mikhail's closet. He reminded Mikhail that he only had a few hours left to prepare, and slammed the door shut before he could respond.\n\nMikhail couldn't even pick out his own outfit, and yet he was supposed to rule all of Russia."

Died: 30 November 1968." There was more, of course, a short paragraph dedicated to the greatness of his life and those he left behind. So, that was why the paper had been delivered. Uncle Feodor was dead.\n\nMikhail stared at the entry, feeling a distant ache that was as forced and invented as it was real. He tried again, saying to himself again and again, "Uncle Feodor is dead".\n\nGod, he had to admit to himself, he didn't really care. It was this realization that hurt him more than the actual death. Was he so distant, so removed from the rest of his family that the death meant so little to him? It wasn't as if they had been close, true, but shouldn't he care more about a death in the family? Mikhail pondered this, wondering if when his own death came, it would be greeted with the same enthusiasm he had mustered.

As so many such events in the old Empire had been, however, it quickly deteriorated as the wine and liquor began to flow freely.\n\nThe first activities the scions organized were fairly tame. Cards and other games of chance accompanied by heavy gambling, of course. As the level of inebriation increased, and as the wagers grew, the competitions grew more intense, with outcomes that would not be subsequently spoken of in polite company.\n\nBy night's end, several small fortunes had been won and lost, reputations had been built and tarnished, and, as all the 'esteemed' guests and the scions themselves could agree the next morning, a great time was had by all.\n\nAt long last, proper 'society' had returned to Chita."

Only then did thoughts return to him. He knew he should feel relieved. After all, he was returning to the place he had always known was his true home. But instead he felt only despair.\n\nHad he truly done enough? What would become of the lands he had left? He had tried to make Russia a better place, doing what he could to encourage reform and bring peace to the troubled land. But, in the end, he was leaving it in the hands of Shepunov, a man who knew only war. And there was nothing he could do about it\n\nSighing, Mikhail looked out the window again, and resigned himself to his fate."

The circumstances of Mikhail's removal still troubled him, but the old prince was not going to let such lingering worries stand in the way of this moment.\n\nSlowly, carefully, Nikita reached out to take the crown from the bishop's hands, and gently placed it upon his head. It was not the same used by the Tsars of old, but that mattered little. The metals and jewels could change, but the God-given authority they represented was eternal. From this moment onward, he was an emperor.\n\nThe bishop continued with the ceremony. "Most God fearing, absolute, and mighty Lord, Tsar of all the Russias, this visible and tangible adornment of thy head is an eloquent symbol that thou, as the head of the whole Russian people, art invisibly crowned by the King of kings, Christ, with a most ample blessing, seeing that He bestows upon thee entire authority over His people."\n\nThe bishop handed Nikita his scepter and orb and as he received them, moving towards the throne for the next part of the ceremony, he couldn't help but see Shepunov watching him from the front row of the cathedral, eyes narrowed and unblinking. Nikita suppressed a shudder. Would the military treat him the same way as it had his nephew? What would happen if Shepunov tired of him?\n\nHe had no answer, and sweeping those thoughts aside, he took solace in that, for now at least, he was the new face of the Russian monarchist movement. Russia needed a worthy Tsar now more than ever, and Nikita was more than eager to fulfill that role."

You see, my life has become rather complicated as of late, and to lay the story out in its entirety would be a daunting task indeed. I write to you now not only because of the time that has passed, but also because you have likely seen the news by now and are confused beyond belief. If not, I will still try my best to explain the situation.\n\nAs I'm sure you are aware, I decided to stay in Australia after my service with the Fleet Air Arm. My life in the so-called land down under was relatively carefree, and I look back on those days with fondness. Sadly, it was not to last. Several years ago, I received an invitation by influential Russian émigrés in Harbin to attend a banquet celebrating the legacy of our family. One thing led to another, and I found myself being crowned as the Tsar of All Russia in the frozen wastes of Siberia.\n\nDespite their generous show of goodwill, these old whites merely wanted to use me as a puppet to fulfill their dreams of domination over Russia and her people. I was kept as a prisoner in my own home, the days spent there becoming some of the darkest in my entire life. Despite the hopelessness of my situation, I had come to the conclusion that my arrival in Russia was a sign.\n\nNo matter the circumstance of my birth, a Romanov should never shy away in cowardice when his divinely-ordained realm needs him most. With the help of some like minded allies, I seized power from those corrupt White generals and became the Tsar I was always destined to be. I understand if this worries you, but know that while I did not choose this fate, may my soul be damned if I don't make the best of it.

A short silence replaced the bitter laugh.\n\n"So," began Boris, his smile gone, "are you here just to gloat? To bask in your glory, oh great and wonderful Tsar?"\n\n"Actually," said Mikhail, his face still upturned in the shape of a faint smile, "I am here to tell you that you are being released to the Manchurian city of Harbin.

"Go on, I wish to hear of your reasons."\n\n"Your Excellency, I disagree with this because making an army loyal to our country as well as the Tsar is what allowed for such people as Shepunov, believing themselves above their station in the name of 'protecting the people.' While I do believe that some excesses should be curbed, by in large, the army should be loyal to the Tsar and his will."\n\n"That is just nonsense," responded Volkogonov, his voice rising, "the reason people like Shepunov had such influence is because they had His Excellency as a figurehead, using him as another term for 'the nation' rather than their own personal interests. By combining them as one in the same, we can avoid that from ever happening again."\n\nSobchak laughed.

Knocking on the door to draw their attention, she managed to draw their foreman over to speak to her.\n\nThe man confirmed her fears.

An educated fellow, he very patiently explained that the new policies of the Tsar's government had made it impossible for the zaibatsu to compete with the Imperial Corporations, including the one that had purchased the building. But, he assured her with a wide smile, the new owners intended to provide the exact same types of products, while making the state stronger at the same time. Only now, those products would be made in Siberia, rather than in the factories of Japan.\n\nGalina managed a weak smile, thanked the man, and left. She knew the old store would not be coming back.

His ministers, soldiers, airmen, and other civil servants had, in his name, secured control over almost all of Russia proper. They had defeated fascists, communists, bandits, and more. And they had returned security to millions upon millions of ordinary Russians.\n\nIt was, therefore, only natural that he formally announced his claim to the long-vacant Imperial throne, and thus his government's claim as the successor to, and reincarnation of, the Russian Empire. To many within the lands his state controlled this would seem an almost academic statement. Mikhail had been called Tsar for many years, even before he had secured power over the White officer cliques.\n\nBut politically, and more importantly internationally, it was anything but.
