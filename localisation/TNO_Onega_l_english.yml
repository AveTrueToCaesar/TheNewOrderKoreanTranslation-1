 ### Politics Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_KIRPICHNIKOV_DESC:0 "제2차 세계대전 이전, 블라디미르 바실레비치 키르피치니코프는 붉은 군대의 평범한 지휘관에 지나지 않았다. 많은 이들은 그가 용감하게 적과 싸워서 소련의 영웅으로서 죽을 운명일 것이라고 생각했지만, 그것은 그의 운명이 아니었다. 러시아가 혼란에 빠지기 직전 몇 달 동안, 키르피치니코프는 제43보병사단을 이끌고 카렐리야 지협에서 핀란드군과 전투를 벌이게 된다. 우세한 적의 전술은 소련군의 전선을 붕괴시켰고, 43사단은 거의 와해될 뻔했다. 키르피치니코프는 혼란스러운 퇴각 도중 붙잡혔고 핀란드군에 의해 심문을 받고 억류당했다.\n\n장군은 서러시아 전쟁이 일어날 때까지 수감되었다. 동부전선 종전 이후 핀란드는 독일군 덕에 러시아 내 혼란으로부터 보호받을 수 있었으나 서러시아 혁명전선이 A-A선을 침범하자 핀란드는 위기에 처했다. 이제 그들은 스스로 국경을 방어해야 했다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 핀란드군은 다름 아닌 키르피치니코프 자신이 이끄는 러시아인들로 구성된 반공의용방위대를 창설했다. 핀란드는 만일 그들이 아르한겔스크에서 빨갱이를 몰아낸다면 그들에게 정착할 땅을 주고 독립을 주겠다고 약속했다.\n\n현재 키르피치니코프는 오네가를 중심으로 하는 작은 군벌 국가를 통치하고 있으며, 서러혁전과 맞서고 있다. 핀란드는 여전히 어느 정도 이들에 대한 통제를 하고 있지만, 키르피치니코프의 방범대가 아르한겔스크를 공산당의 지배로부터 해방시킬 경우, 카렐리야의 러시아인들은 마침내 다시 한 번 자유로워질 것이다."

 VTY_removetheradicals_desc:0 "서러시아 혁명 전선의 패배와 붕괴 이후, 50년대 핀란드 정부는 카렐리야를 합병하고 오네가를 수립하기로 결정했습니다. 서러시아의 혼란을 막기 위한 미봉책이자 핀란드를 위협하는 동쪽 세력을 막는 첫번째 방어선이었죠. 옛 소련의 다양한 지역에서 모인 러시아 망명자들이 세운 이 나라는 핀란드의 계속되는 지원을 통한 정치적 중립성 보장 덕에 근근히 살아가고 있습니다.\n\n이 지원은 계속되어야 할 것이며, 좌우의 극단주의자들이 권력을 잡게 된다면, 국가의 근간이 흔들릴 것입니다. 우리는 그들을 정부, 군대, 정치조직에서 완전히 몰아내야 합니다. 우리는 어느 한쪽으로 치우치지 않을 것이며, 홀로 서있을 것입니다."

Dozens of small groups of bandits or former soldiers still resist our authority, hiding in the mountains and launching raids on towns and villages. Often, they are devoted to the same regimes we fought so hard to bring down. From now on, we cannot allow this to happen as the rulers of North Russia.\n\nThe Volunteer Guard's job, besides protecting the nation from the few external threats that exist, is dealing with these bandits. Increased patrols, a recruitment drive and utilizing local support will all be crucial in restoring order, and creating a sense of safety and stability."

This had served its purpose quite well, and for a long time we were able to successfully fend off the threat of internal infiltration by communists and other radicals.\n\nBut as the republic liberalizes, many have brought into question the continued role of the government in surveilling their citizens, especially the economic issues of trying to do so across all of Western Russia.

After the bandits raided his farm and murdered his parents, he had no home to go back to. That's when he joined the Volunteer Guard. Although, he didn't expect to have to sit outside frivolous places like barracks full of guards or a secure armory in the safest place in all of Onega. Why wasn't Dimitri allowed to get his revenge and have a little fun? The rest of the guard was busy hunting bandits while he had to enforce order and wait for the bandits to come to him. While it might not be fair, at least they gave him a home here.\n\nDmitri waited for the end of his shift which was still five hours away. Perhaps one day he won't have to stand here for hours and stare at the other building across from him. At least a cat came by once in a while that he got to pet. But who knows, there was always the chance he could be called in to attack some bandit hideout in some random forest. Hopefully, he would get his chance."

It was just another day for Andrei, searching each vehicle that came through for smuggled weapons. Not much activity had been through today though.\n\nA few hours passed and a truck finally came to a stop at the checkpoint. The chief officer, Grigori, walked over to the driver as Andrei went to the back of the truck. Just another search. However, it was a bit strange for a supply truck to arrive at this time of night. They must be really behind schedule.\n\nThe driver kept arguing they didn't need a search, and they were already authorized to bypass this checkpoint. After too many complaints of them being late and that the food was going to spoil, Grigori gave up on the search and walked back to the checkpoint to let the barrier up. But that was against protocol. All vehicles needed to be searched by the checkpoint before they were allowed through. Andrei knew something seemed off about this.\n\nWary but unsure if it meant anything, Andrei took matters into his own hands and forced open the back of the truck. Three distinct human shapes were visible in the darkness, but before he could figure out who they were, a shot rang through his ears and a scream came from Grigori. Something swung towards his vision before he could react, and everything went black. "

It was strange to see them just out in the open like this, almost as if they are waiting to be attacked. Shouldn't they be living underground in some dark and grimy cave instead of this beautiful, large white house? They should at least be smart enough to hide and lay low, but perhaps these ones aren't too bright. After all, bandits usually aren't the smartest.\n\nA shocking charge would do the trick, those bandits would surely be outnumbered. Once every man stood ready, the assault commenced. More than a hundred Volunteer Guards charged up the hill and the slaughter began. Machine gun bullets rained upon the attacking troops from positions in the windows of the house, striking them down as if they were little toy soldiers a child would play with and flick them over with their finger. This was supposed to be just another hideout with a few careless bandits with hunting rifles. Not a well-armed fortress full of bandits with large machinegun nests. How did the bandits have this type of weaponry? Not even Onega's garrisons are this well-equipped.\n\nAlmost as quickly as they had begun charging up the hill, the brave Volunteer Guard was fleeing down in terror. But it wouldn't end there, even as the Volunteers reached the bottom it went on. The barrage of bullets wouldn't end until they made it back to their camp, exhausted and covered in blood.\n\nThe dead and missing were accounted for and the Guard finally got a chance to rest. Later that night a communication was sent out to the next regiment commander.\n\n"We failed again, the soldiers acted more like scared little girls than fearless men. It's your turn now.

But with the Volunteer Guard finally outside, those poor bandits had no idea what was coming for them.\n\nThe elite Volunteer Guard broke through the barriers before the bandits even knew what hit them.

Clumsy bandits had no chance compared to the best Volunteers in Russia.\n\nWithin a few minutes almost every bandit was either dead or captured, with few guard casualties.

The Guard had been his work - the creation, organization, and recruitment of soldiers into it; it certainly hadn't been an easy task. Truthfully, ever since his capture and imprisonment by the Finns, Kirpichnikov had missed organizing and commanding troops.\n\nBut even then, with the "gift" that they had bestowed upon him, he was reminded of the true nature of his post. He was well-aware of his being little more than a pawn to the interests of Helsinki. And he was just as aware that his actions in Onega and beyond had been more than mildly authoritarian. He was a military dictator, simply put, and one propped up by the Finnish government at that. It was a position that caused him great ambivalence; on one hand, he could protect those within his fiefdom and serve the interests of Karelian Russians. On the other, he only did so as a means to Finnish ends, and any dissension - especially from communist elements, wasn't tolerated. The stern look on Kirpichnikov's face as he looked down on his Volunteer Guard training betrayed few of the emotions that he felt. Ultimately, the ex-Soviet general thought to himself, his position as leader of the Guard wasn't one that sat right with him in his gut.\n\nA trumped up dictator based out of the small timber town of Onega was hardly a fitting or prestigious legacy for a Soviet commander. But Kirpichnikov had little love lost for the Soviets, under Bukharin but even more so under the military rule of Kliment Voroshilov, who had treated the Russian people with all manners of cruelty during the German invasion. Snapped out of his thoughts by a subordinate's call, he banished his ambivalence to the background of his mind and began his weekly inspection."

Unfortunately, most of what Kirpichnikov had drawn up was entirely unrealistic. His more cynical commanders would even suggest to one another, well out of earshot of their leader, that his planned offensives were little more than pure fantasy.\n\nBut what was the man to do, if not wargame? His Guard ran on autopilot - the result of his nurturing a strong and relatively independent command structure, and Kirpichnikov had never been a micromanager anyhow. But, as the leader of the Finnish satellite state often reminded himself, the Finns had promised him something: his freedom, and the freedom of a subsequent government, if he was able to take Arkhangelsk and end the West Russian Revolutionary Front once and for all.\n\nPerhaps it was the general's old guilt and ambivalence that translated into his ambition to take the city and end the Soviet remnant once and for all, thought many of his subordinates. To a degree, they were right. None of the Volunteer Guard's officer corps had any love for the Finns. But what the officers didn't know, is that Kirpichnikov was more motivated by a hope for redemption, rather than by guilt. Oftentimes, late at night, when sleep eluded the aging general, he would walk, in the cold night air and without any guards, to his office, and look over his plans, imagining the aftermath of his fictional victory. It was during one of these nights that, despite his ambivalence for his own role and weariness regarding the Soviets, he resolved that he would beat them or die trying."

"Regardless," Kirpichnikov began, rubbing his right temple with his hand. "This news is... Voroshilov... dead..." the general's mouth stretched downwards as he became lost in thought.\n\nThe pair of men had once been comrades, serving the Union and her people alongside one another. Things had been different then, Kirpichnikov reminded himself. But that didn't stop the general from reminiscing about his past, when he fought for, rather than against, the Soviet system. He barely muttered "dismissed" to the aide as he looked down at the neat typeface on the telegram. As he heard his office door shut, he reached down in his desk and opened a drawer, carefully pulling out a neatly-wrapped cloth. Unfolding it revealed a creased picture, well-worn with time. Kirpichnikov gently took the picture and unfolded it. Kirpichnikov could still make out the faces, the smiles. His one comrade waving at the camera. It was just after he had been named commander of the 43rd Rifle Division.\n\nHe looked at the photo for what must have been ten minutes, reliving the moment. The photo had begun to fade, but the memory was as crisp in Kirpichnikov's head as if it had happened just the day prior. The happiness he had felt, the sense of accomplishment. Things he hadn't felt for quite some time. Voroshilov's passing may have presented both an opportunity and a change in the Guard's strategies, but Kirpichnikov decided that all of that could wait for one day."

The Finnish government had expelled another three villages' worth of Karelian Russians to his territory to make room for more Finnish settlers. As more Russian refugees arrived in Onega, they brought with them almost nothing, and needed a lot in return. Food, shelter, water, all things that were in short supply in the town of Onega and what little territory Kirpichnikov controlled. He cared for the refugees, as he would any Russian. But the rate at which the Finns were shoving them into his territory was becoming unsustainable. He sat at his desk and began typing at his typewriter. Angry letters, all capitals, addressed to the Finnish government and their leader, Karl Lennart Oesch.\n\nBut as he typed, Kirpichnikov's anger slowly left him. He was brought back to the days of his imprisonment, and the way the Finns had treated him. He remembered his personal "chats" with Oesch, at that time a mere general in the Finnish army. One memory burned brighter than most: Kirpichnikov had been starved for days, only being given food after posing for a photograph - lighting Oesch's cigarette. A coup d'etat for Finnish propaganda. He couldn't go back to that. Ripping the page from his typewriter, he crumpled it up, and went to work finding resources for the refugees he couldn't support."

 VTY.54.desc:0 "In the presidential palace of the Tatar Republic, a badly renovated Governor's residence from the Imperial era, Mikhail Alexeevich and Ibrigim Mingazeyev discussed the options of the Tatar people. Alexeevich was an old bureaucrat from the early days of Kerensky's government and the Civil War. More than all of that, he was an expert on the diplomatic scene. Ibragim was eager to secure a future for the people of the Republic, but he was very hesitant to put the lives of his people in the hands of those same men who repressed them in the old days. At the same time, he knew that the Tatar Republic could not survive alone.\n\n"Mr. Alexeevich, our talks have been very fruitful thus far, but before we continue I would like certain assurances," Ibragim was insistent. The talks had gone on for three hours by that point and, though much progress had been made, the hesitancy of the NRR to commit fully to Tatar autonomy gave him pause.\n\n"Name your terms, my friend. I will do everything in my power to see them done," Alexeevich was serious, not necessarily because of any high ideals but for the defense of Russia from extremist forces.\n\n"There must be assurances that your government will not attempt to infringe on Tatar autonomy. If they cannot, then all we have done here is waste our time."\n\n"I will do all that I can to see that your terms are met, you have my word," the bureaucrat said. With that very tentative assurance, Ibragim was reluctantly prepared to sign the treaty."

 VTY.55.desc:0 "In a musty room in the former headquarters of the ROA, Viktor Polyakov was deep in talks with a very shady man from the North Russian Republic. The man, Alexandr Ivanov, spoke with a voice of honey, though his eyes held a dark glint. As they talked, it became clear that Viktor was completely out of his depth. Alexandr was quick to take advantage of the engineer's naivety and inexperience in order to craft terms favorable to the NRR. Though the treaty that came from Ivanov's underhanded tactics was a somewhat plain grab for influence in the region, it still afforded the Assembly protection from threats to its sovereignty and ensured that they were insulated against untoward influence - aside from NRR influence, of course.\n\nAfter an hour of schmoozing, Viktor and his supporters were convinced on the contents of the treaty. With the swipe of a pen, the People's Assembly of Samara was afforded the protection of the North Russian Republic.\n\nOver the course of the next week, Alexsandr would ingratiate himself with Viktor and his people, promising shipments of luxury goods unseen in Samara for years. And, over the days since the signing of the treaty, a steady flow of new furniture, fruits, meats, and clothing entered the homes of Samara through the back channels of the NRR and their allies in Finland."

 VTY.56.desc:0 "In the palace of Vladimir III, the new Prince of Vyatka and his court, along with a representative from the Mari Republic, met the delegation from the North Russian Republic. Prince Boris was a man that simply oozed charisma. He had relied on that charisma throughout his life, and it served him well today, as he ran circles around the inexperienced man from the NRR, a recently promoted soldier from Onega, and turned the negotiations in favor of his new Principality of Vyatka, and to a very lesser extent to the Mari Republic.\n\n"No, no, I insist. You simply must take this gift." The Prince of Vyatka was a magnanimous man if one didn't test him, and he knew how to get what he wanted. Colonel Zyklov, the representative from Onega, came to Vyatka prepared to grant concessions, but he had been taken in by the Prince's charms. As a result, Boris was able to weasel more and more concessions from the Republic.\n\n"If you insist, your highness." The Colonel knew he was out of his depth. He had grown up in Onega and been fast-tracked to service with the Anti-Communist Guard. His whole life had been dedicated to fighting the Communists, with little thought to politics, of all things. Now he was responsible for negotiations better handled by a team of diplomats, not a man barely into his thirties granted responsibilities far above his abilities.\n\n"Now, my friend, I believe we have the treaty to sign."\n\n"Yes, of course.""

 VTY.57.desc:0 "It was a crisp morning in Izhevsk when the North Russian Republic's representative entered the government headquarters of the Udmurt Republic. He was a perfect example of the eclectic and slapdash nature of the NRR. Born and raised in Sweden, William Johansson was a diplomat to his core. In the chaos of the West Russian War he had volunteered with the Finnish military to beat back the communists, and afterwards he had settled in Onega with the Anti-Communist Guard. Now, he put his education in the diplomatic arena to good use for his new homeland.\n\nOver the course of the next week, William and the recently elected leader of the Republic, Yakov Elizarovich Panteleyev, negotiated a treaty of trade and mutual assistance. Though Panteleyev had little experience in the political arena, he held his own. Foremost he held the interests of his people in mind, and had contested any terms that looked to shackle the Udmurt people.\n\nAt the end of the day, the North Russian Republic and the Udmurt Republic wanted the same thing, at least in the short term. It was a simple matter to ensure the sovereignty of the Udmurt Republic, as the situation in West Russia precluded any consolidated conquest of the region, and the Republic would become yet another member of the alliance network that would, hopefully, keep West Russia at peace.\n\nIn the aftermath of the treaty signing, William would find that he quite liked the people of Izhevsk. Perhaps he would request a permanent station in the city - he was growing fond of it."

 VTY.58.desc:0 "The diplomatic convoy arrived at the newly rebuilt presidential palace of the Republic of Bashkortostan with little fanfare. The representative from the North Russian Republic, a surly military man named Yuri who was originally from Perm, stepped out of his armored car and was led by a functionary to a conference room set aside for the negotiations. His counterpart was a local man by the name of Faizrakhman Zagafuranov. He had been a supporter of Bashkir rights in the Soviet bureaucracy and had seemed a perfect choice for the North Russian Republic to place in charge of the reformed Republic. In Yuri's opinion the man did not deserve to shine his shoes, much less lead a secessionist party in rightful Russian lands.\n\nThe negotiations would last for a whole week before real progress was made, as the experienced bureaucrat pushed in just the right places. For much of the negotiations, Yuri refused to entertain the possibility of anything less than full subordination of the Bashkirs under the NRR. The very idea of Russian land under the control of muslim dogs made his skin crawl.\n\nIn the end, Yuri would be escorted out of the building by his own guards, spewing racial slurs and demanding the annexation of the Bashkir lands. After a phone call from the NRR's headquarters, he was released from duty. In his place was an ethnic Bashkir who was much more amenable to the terms put forward by Zagafuranov. It would take only three more days for the treaty to be signed, and the Bashkir people were once again secure in their independence."

A palpable gloom had descended on the once vibrant city, and even so long after the fall of the Brotherhood there were signs everywhere of its influence. Murals depicting the victories of the so-called "Aryan race", statues to the Brotherhood's unholy patrons, and the burned out storefronts of those not "pure" enough for the cult's liking... it all painted a picture of a city oppressed by the worst of humanity. In truth, the sight of his childhood home in such a state was almost enough to bring Colonel Ivan Smirnov to tears.\n\nWhen the motorcade pulled up to the central government building in Perm, an imitation of the wasteful Volkshalle in Germania, he saw the first glimmer of hope for his old home. There, waiting at the end of the steps leading into the building, was a surly man who he had known for years. "Alexander, you old bastard! You're still alive!?" were the first words out of Ivan's mouth as he stepped out of his car. Ivan had known Alexander for years. They had been childhood friends and had fought together in the Great Patriotic War. The last he had seen of him had been in one of the USSR's final doomed offenses into Ukraine.\n\n"Ivan!" Alexander's voice boomed. "How good it is to see you! And a Colonel, eh? Last I remember, you would have sooner charged head first into German lines before becoming an officer!"\n\n"Times change, my friend, times change." It was true, in the old days he hated the officers more than anything, and yet here he was. A dedicated officer to a new Russian state.\n\n"All too true. Come, my friend. We have much to discuss. Over a drink, perhaps?"\n\nOne drink turned to three which turned to twelve. After that all was a blur. By the next day, Ivan and Alexander had hashed out a surprisingly extensive treaty, one that would ensure Perm's safety and prosperity."
