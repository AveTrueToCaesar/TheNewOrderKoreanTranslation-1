 POLITICS_Felix_Steiner_DESC:0 "안돼. 하나님. 안돼. 멈춰야해. 싸움을 끝내야 해. 대립을 끝내야 해. 긴장을 끝내야 해. 그렇지 않으면 우린 전부 죽을거야.\n\n펠릭스 슈타이너는 세기가 바뀌는 그 순간에 고향 독일에서 태어났습니다. 제1차 세계 대전에 끌려가기에 딱 좋은 순간에 태어난거죠. 그 전쟁에서 슈타이너는 싸우고 피흘렸고 철십자 훈장을 받았습니다. 1급 훈장과 2급 훈장 둘 다요. 그렇지만 베르사유에서 서명된 종이 쪼가리 몇 장이 슈타이너의 전쟁을 끝내지는 못했습니다. 그는 자유군단이라는 준군사조직에 입단하며 군국주의로의 길을 걷기 시작했습니다. 결국 창설된 슈츠슈타펠 소속으로 전쟁에 뛰어든 펠릭스 슈타이너는 무장SS에 자원한 스칸디나비아 출신자로만 이루어진 제5S기갑사단 비킹을 창설할 권한으로 보답 받았습니다. 비킹은 동방에서 조국과 함께 승리로 행진했지요.\n\nAfter the war, however, Felix Steiner would come to know the nooses of National Socialist bureaucracy quickly, powerfully, and dangerously. Being assigned away from the volunteer Division he fathered, Steiner found himself administering over the active servicemen and the veterans of the Schutzstaffel, Waffen-SS, and even the Wehrmacht. During the era of crisis that would strangle the former prestige of the Reich, Steiner would come to know a closeness towards all servicemen of the Reich, believing their delve into the warrior spirit to earn anyone favor as an Aryan soldier, be they from the Schutzstaffel or the Wehrmacht. Some looked disfavorably upon this egalitarian notion; however, Steiner himself felt satisfied in cleaning up accusations of crimes during and after the war for many of the servicemen he served himself.\n\nHowever, an era of crisis would breed an era of fire. Now, the Deutsche-SS and the forces of the Ordenstaat butcher each other in the streets, and Steiner only has so many pawns to use in this game. The members of the Schutzstaffel and Wehrmacht that he's untied in his state are at a constant pin drop away from opening fire upon one another. A cost he cannot afford when he's attempting to weather Heydrich's and Himmler's storms on both sides."

 AGS_Angriffsgruppe_Standoff_desc:0 "Steiner, commander of the Wiking Panzer Division, has taken up arms and formed a government in Frankfurt. With a large pool of manpower, he has managed to take control of the nearby region. Members of the Wehrmacht who found themselves unwilling to join Gehlen's Rebellion in the south opted instead for the comparitetly safety and security that Steiner offered. With the liberal use of hostages, correccion, blackmail, kidnapping, and more, Steiner has, for the moment, secured and largely pacified his holdings. Though his position is tenuous at best, the large body of SS and Wehrmacht soldiers at his beck and call ensures Steiner's continued rule."
  
 AGS_Glorious_Warfare:0 "The Glory of Warfare"
 AGS_Glorious_Warfare_desc:0 "There is nothing more fine in this world than a column of men marching in step. Nothing is as honest as a victory paid for in blood, nothing makes a man like a spirited battle, and nothing defines a nation like the quality of its soldiers! And it is clear to us that, out of all the scattered factions of the lands, our men are the best! It is time to put petty squabbles between the Wehrmacht and SS aside; it is time to unify the rest of the Fatherland in glorious battle, purchased honestly with our blood!"
