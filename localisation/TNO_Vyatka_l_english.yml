 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_TSAR_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "1917년 망명 중 태어난 블라디미르 키릴로비치 로마노프 대공은 1938년 고인이 된 차르 니콜라 2세의 사촌인 아버지 키릴 블라디미로비치의 죽음으로 러시아 황실의 우두머리가 되었습니다.\n\n2차 세계대전 당시엔 브르타뉴에 거주하였고, 그는 곧 자신과 그의 가족이 독일에 유치되어 있다는 것을 알았습니다. 독일 당국의 '침묵'에 그는 곧 협력에 나서면서 러시아의 탈소련 체제를 부추기는 라디오 방송을 만들었습니다. 전쟁 말기엔 우크라이나 섭정을 제의받았고, 그는 그것이 용납할 수 없을 정도로 러시아를 분열시킨다는 이유로 거절했습니다.\n\n그러나 전쟁이 끝났음에도 불구하고, 독일인들은 블라소프와 마찬가지로 그의 인기가 그들의 통치를 약화시킬 수 있다고 우려해서 블라디미르는 러시아로 다시 돌아갈 수 없었습니다. 서러시아 전쟁이 되어서야 그는 자신이 군주주의자들과 추방된 백군들로 구성된 사단을 규합하는 것을 허용하도록 그들을 설득할 수 있었습니다. 그러나 독일 국방군의 공세가 중단되자, 블라디미르는 러시아에서 통치권을 구축하기 위해 돌파하지 못했습니다.\n\n그 후 몇년 동안 새로 선포된 차르 블라디미르 3세는 그의 통치권을 확장하는데 거의 성공하지 못했고, 그외에도 많은 국내 문제들이 발견되고 있습니다. 이제 러시아의 차르는 확장할 수 있는 순간까지 시간을 벌며 기다리고 있습니다. 그의 신성한 권리로 모든 러시아를 되찾을 수 있는 그 순간까지 말입니다."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SKOSSYREFF_DESC:0 "서러시아의 마지막 군주인 보리스 1세의 이야기는 특이하지만 매력적입니다. 보리스 미하일로비치 스코시레프는 당시 러시아 제국의 일부였던 빌나의 부유한 가정에서 태어났습니다. 그가 상류층의 일부이었던 동안, 그는 태어났을때부터 왕위요구자가 결코 아니었으나 그가 혈통을 통해 얻을수 없는 것을 그가 스스로 얻은 것입니다.\n\n10월 혁명이 일어나자 보리스는 도망쳐 수많은 이민자 중 한명이 되었습니다. 그는 곧 영국 외무부에 자신을 알리고 네덜란드에 도착하기 전에 많은 임무에 참여한 다음 지금까지 그의 가장 유명한 모험이 펼쳐질 곳인 안도라를 찾았습니다. 신중하게 계획한 후, 그는 1930년대 대중들의 지지를 받아 공작이라는 칭호를 얻었고, 안도라를 현대로 이끌것을 약속했습니다. 그는 곧 체포되어 수감 될 것이지만 운 좋게도 서유럽 주변의 감옥에서 몇 년을 보낸 후 나치에 의해 석방되어 그들과 협력하기 시작했습니다. 서러시아 전쟁의 도래와 차르 블라디미르의 원정에 그는 기꺼이 그와 합류했고, 그의 충성심이 불편해질 때까지 충성스러운 연락원으로 그의 곁에 섰습니다.\n\n스코시레프는 반공 경비대가 승리를 거두었지만 한가롭게 지내진 않았습니다. 어느 날, 군대가 뱟카에 가까워지자 그는 총을 쏴서 시내 중심으로 와 키르피치니코프의 군대로 대체된 옛 서러시아의 권위를 종식시키겠다고 선언했습니다. 도시의 부패한 통치자들을 대신하여 보리스 1세는 이제 반공 경비대와 러시아 국민의 이름으로 뱟카의 공작과 국경의 수호자로 군림합니다. 이 공국이 얼마나 오래 지속될진 누가 알겠습니까?"

 ### Ideas ###
 KIR_unrepentant_reaction:0 "부끄럼 없는 반응"
 KIR_unrepentant_reaction_desc:0 "옛 러시아 제국이 멸망한 이후 우리는 계속해서 폭군 밑에 깔려 고통받고 있습니다. 공산주의자와 숨겨진 대리인 사회주의는 러시아 국민들이 남긴 작은 것을 빼앗기 위해 지칠 줄 모르고 노력해 왔으며, 이에 대하여 차르는 '더 이상은 안된다!'라고 선언하셨습니다. 제국은 다시 부활하고 공산주의자들은 멸망할 것이며 차르의 정당한 통치로 평화는 다시 위대한 땅, 러시아로 돌아올 것입니다."

 KIR_officer_infighting:0 "군대에서의 내분"
 KIR_officer_infighting_desc:0 "백군, 또는 그 잔재들은 한번도 통일 전선을 이룬적이 없습니다. 공산주의에 대한 공통된 증오로 그들은 하나로 뭉치겠지만, 통일된 러시아가 어떻게 통치되어야 하는가에 대한 질문은 차르의 충성스러운 군대의 단결을 깨뜨릴 위험이 있습니다. 일부는 오래된 이상을 믿고, 일부는 민주주의를 원하며, 일부는 파시즘 정권의 강점에 대해 이야기합니다. 차르만이 그들을 묶어두는 유일한 존재입니다. 국가가 잃어버린 것을 재건하려면 군대가 단결해야 한다는 것은 분명합니다."

 KIR_officers_reigned_in:0 "합류한 장교들"
 KIR_officers_reigned_in_desc:0 "비록 어려웠지만, 국가는 군 장교단의 최악의 영향과 행동들을 모두 억제하는 데 성공했습니다. 비록 문제가 있는 장교들을 면직시키거나 기소되어 시간이 걸리고 정치적 영향력과 인력 차질을 야기할 것이지만, 차르께서는 그의 장교들이 곧 의도적으로 단결될 것이라고 확신할 수 있습니다. 분열된 지도부는 더 이상 아군에 부정적인 영향을 미치지 않을 것입니다."

 KIR_the_tsar_and_himself:0 "차르께서 직접 나서다"
 KIR_the_tsar_and_himself_desc:0 "옛날처럼 차르께서는 절대 권력으로 다스립니다. 그러나 최근 들어 자유주의와 민주적 이상이 신하들의 마음과 마음 속에서 떠오르는 것을 목격하고 있습니다. 비록 많은 사람들이 그에게 이러한 발전들을 완전히 무시하라고 조언하고 있지만, 차르께서는 자기가 벼랑 끝에 서 있다는 것을 잘 알고 있습니다. 차르는 그의 백성들의 사랑이 예전처럼 매우 빠르게 증오로 변할 수 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 그러므로 그는 곧 다음과 같은 선택을 해야 합니다. 그의 조상들이 그랬던 것처럼 혼자서 통치하거나, 아니면 그의 정부에서 백성들에게 그들의 발언권을 주는 것입니다."

 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_idea:0 "사람들의 황제"
 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_idea_desc:0 "차르께서는 자신의 여러 단체들과 연대하는 모습을 보여주려는 그의 노력에 발맞춰, 노동자들을 만나고 그들에게 가장 큰 영향을 미치는 문제들을 해결하기 위해 행동하며, 많은 공장과 산업 시설들을 정신없이 빠르게 진행되는 순방 계획에 착수하셨습니다. 비록 그렇게 함으로써 얻는 정치적 이익에 아무도 흠을 잡을 수 없고, 차르의 개인적인 관심이 의심 할 여지없이 높은 생산 수준을 보여주기 위해 최선을 다하는 공장으로 이어질 것이지만, 선언된 '솔루션'이 갑자기 시행되면서 효율성이 떨어질 가능성이 높습니다."

 KIR_imperial_detachment_idea:0 "제국 분견대"
 KIR_imperial_detachment_idea_desc:0 "군주로서의 역할에 중요한 성격의 무형적 측면을 보존하고 홍보의 문제보다는 국가 문제에 초점을 맞추기로 한 차르의 결정은, 비록 그의 사람들 모두의 마음에 남아있지만, 그가 많은 사건에서 개인적으로 물러나는 결과를 가져왔습니다. 이것은 사회에 명백해지기 전에 차르께서 문제를 해결하고 있다는 사실을 알고 안심할 수 있는 많은 사람들에겐 의심의 여지가 없지만, 분견대를 통해 그의 지위를 대중들에게 알리려면 추가적인 노력이 필요합니다."

 KIR_kirov_vodka:0 "보드카"
 KIR_kirov_vodka_desc:0 "뱟카 증류기는 국내에서 소비하거나 해외로 수출하거나 의료·군사적 환경에서 고품질 방부제로서 사용할 수 있는 고품질 양주를 대량 생산하여 본격 가동하고 있습니다. 비록 그것이 어떤 사람들에게는 유머러스하게 보일수 있지만, 보드카는 러시아의 주식이고, 소비되는 모든 병에 수반되는 차르에 대한 생각들로 모두가 통일의 꿈을 추구하기 위해 더 열심히 일하고 덜 낭비하도록 영감을 받게됩니다."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana:0 "현대의 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_desc:0 "차르께서는 황실의 첩보부대와 반혁명 경찰대인 오흐라나를 현명하게 재구성 하셨습니다. 헌신적인 자원들과 국내외 적으로부터 국가를 보호한다는 이념을 바탕으로 그들은 국가의 암호화 능력을 향상시킬뿐만 아니라 적군과 당파의 공격들을 최소화하기 위하여 행동 할 것입니다. 또한 획득한 정보의 공유를 통해 현장에서 군사 지휘관의 전술적 능력을 향상시키는 데에도 기여할 것입니다."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_2:0 "족쇄가 채워진 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_2_desc:0 "국가 안보에 중요하긴 하지만 오흐라나는 감독 없이 운영될 수 없습니다. 이에 따라 과잉을 막기 위한 감독기구가 신설되었습니다. 이는 당연히 효율성을 떨어뜨리지만 지나친 열성행위들이 정치적 안정을 위협하지 않도록 하기 위한 대가입니다."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_3:0 "강화된 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_3_desc:0 "오흐라나의 끊임없는 경계심이 없었다면, 차르 정부는 오래전에 혁명가나 반역자, 혹은 그보다 더 나쁜 자들로 전락했을 것입니다. 그러므로 잠재적인 위협이 실제 위협이 되기 전에 차단하고 제거하는 것에 넓은 범위를 제공해야 합니다. 약간의 '실수'가 발생할 가능성이 높지만 국가 안보를 위해 치러야 할 작은 대가입니다."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_kadet:0 "족쇄가 채워진 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_kadet_desc:0 "국가 안보에 중요하긴 하지만 오흐라나는 감독 없이 운영될 수 없습니다. 이에 따라 과잉을 막기 위한 감독기구가 신설되었습니다. 이는 당연히 효율성을 떨어뜨리지만 지나친 열성행위들이 정치적 안정을 위협하지 않도록 하기 위한 대가입니다."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea:0 "백군의 전통"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea_desc:0 "차르께서는 군대의 전통을 낡고 부패하지 않은 제국주의적 전통과 직접 연결시킴으로써 러시아의 감성을 지닌 진정한 현대군의 형성을 장려해 왔습니다. 단련되었고, 자랑스럽고, 유공자적이고, 잘 조직된 군대는 많은 러시아 국적의 '무기'들보다 월등히 우위에 있으며, 유럽 러시아를 거쳐 극동으로 가는 긴 여정에 당당히 깃발을 들고 다닐 것입니다."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea2:0 "백군의 전통"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea2_desc:0 "차르께서는 군대의 전통을 낡고 부패하지 않은 제국주의적 전통과 직접 연결시킴으로써 러시아의 감성을 지닌 진정한 현대군의 형성을 장려해 왔습니다. 단련되었고, 자랑스럽고, 유공자적이고, 잘 조직된 군대는 많은 러시아 국적의 '무기'들보다 월등히 우위에 있으며, 유럽 러시아를 거쳐 극동으로 가는 긴 여정에 당당히 깃발을 들고 다닐 것입니다."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea_kadet:0 "백군의 전통"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea_kadet_desc:0 "차르께서는 군대의 전통을 낡고 부패하지 않은 제국주의적 전통과 직접 연결시킴으로써 러시아의 감성을 지닌 진정한 현대군의 형성을 장려해 왔습니다. 단련되었고, 자랑스럽고, 유공자적이고, 잘 조직된 군대는 많은 러시아 국적의 '무기'들보다 월등히 우위에 있으며, 유럽 러시아를 거쳐 극동으로 가는 긴 여정에 당당히 깃발을 들고 다닐 것입니다."

 KIR_imperial_special_forces:0 "제국 특수부대"
 KIR_imperial_special_forces_desc:0 "전통에서 벗어나 현대적인 전쟁 방식에 대한 주 정부의 방향 전환의 일환으로, 전문가 구성의 선택과 훈련에 더욱 초점을 맞추고 있습니다. 이러한 초점은 확실히 특수부대의 효율성을 증가시키지만, 엄격한 조건은 적어도 일시적으로 채용을 전반적으로 감소시키는 결과를 낳았습니다."

 KIR_strength_in_numbers_idea:0 "군인 숫자 증가"
 KIR_strength_in_numbers_idea_desc:0 "고전적인 러시아 군대는 인력과 수적 우위에 초점을 맞추면서, 채용을 대폭 확대하고, 기준을 완화하며, 전통적인 영역 밖에서 신병들을 찾고 있습니다. 이것은 더 많은 병사들이 차르의 군대에 들어갈 것이라는걸 의미하지만, 그것은 또한 그들이 적어도 당분간은 훈련 프로그램이 그들의 자연적인 한계를 넘어서 확장되기 때문에 다소 비효율적일 가능성이 있다는 것을 의미하기도 합니다."

 KIR_general_staff_academy:0 "뱟카 작전 참모 아카데미"
 KIR_general_staff_academy_desc:0 "국가 군 장교를 위한 통일적이고 보편적인 훈련 커리큘럼의 구축은 예상대로 전반적인 군사력 증가를 초래했습니다. 제대로 훈련된 장교들이 공통적으로 운영되면서 행정 조직부터 긴축, 미래 장교 후보 파악까지 모든 분야에서 실력을 입증했습니다. 우리의 자신감이 커지는 중입니다."

 KIR_general_staff_academy2:0 "뱟카 작전 참모 아카데미"

 KIR_fortified_position:0 "요새화 된 진지"
 KIR_fortified_position_desc:0 "국가는 최근 이득에 따라 영토를 통합하려는 움직임을 보이고 있습니다. 그 결과, 군대는 방어적인 목적을 지향하면서 보급선을 강화하고, 빨치산과 도적들을 제거하며, 향후 우선순위를 파악하게 되었습니다."

 KIR_archives_of_samara:0 "사마라의 기록보관서"
 KIR_archives_of_samara_desc:0 "사마라는 제 2차 세계대전 당시 소련 국가기록 보관서 역할을 했습니다. 국가가 도시를 점령하고 해당 기록물에 대한 면밀한 검토로 서러시아 혁멍전선의 성격과 대응에 대한 귀중한 통찰력을 얻어 향후 이들에 대한 전투에 도움을 줄것입니다."

 KIR_the_bridgeburners:0 "브릿지버너"
 KIR_the_bridgeburners_desc:0 "'브릿지버너'로 더 잘 알려진 특수 제국 작전부대는 적진 뒤에서 직접 작전을 수행하는 군과 오흐라나 인력으로 구성된 전문 부대입니다. 수송차들을 공격하고, 혼자있는 장교들을 암살하며, 다리를 파괴하는 그들의 활동은 병사들이 교전하기 위해 도착하기 전에도 적의 방어 능력을 방해 할 것입니다."

 KIR_solidarist_constitution:0 "제국 헌법"
 KIR_solidarist_constitution_desc:0 "정부는 부활한 러시아 제국의 첫 번째 제국 헌법 초안을 성공적으로 작성했습니다. 항목이 무엇이든, 차르와 로마노프 왕조 아래 이것은 러시아에 정치적 안정의 복귀를 증명하는 엄청난 업적입니다!"

 KIR_solidarist_economy:0 "계획경제"
 KIR_solidarist_economy_desc:0 "제국 회복 위원회의 계획에 그들의 협동주의 정책을 적용하면서, 연대주의자들은 이익집단의 투입과 산업계획 내의 집중적인 경제분야를 수용했습니다. 이것은 낭비를 줄이려는 공통의 동기가 집중되어 있기 때문에 효율성이 상승하는 이점이 있습니다."

 KIR_unionist_economy:0 "긴축정책"
 KIR_unionist_economy_desc:0 "이전의 긴축정책을 계속하면서, 제국 회복 위원회의 감독하에, 전국연합은 거의 모든 사회분야에서 정부 지출을 계속 제한해왔습니다. 정치적으로 도전적이기는 하지만, 산업의 점점 더 많은 비율이 군수적인 목적을 지향하도록 허용했습니다."

 KIR_kadet_economy:0 "자유주의 경제"
 KIR_kadet_economy_desc:0 "카데트는 제국 회복 위원회의 계획에 자유화 정책을 적용하면서 이전의 긴축 정책을 종식시키고 자유 시장 개혁을 도입했습니다. 일부 사람들은 이러한 변화들이 급진적이라고 생각하지만, 이미 그에 상응하는 생산 수준의 증가에서 보여진 상당한 경제적 확장을 촉진시켰습니다."

 KIR_revitalizing_the_russian_spirit_desc:0 "국민들에게 한땐 있었던 제국의 신뢰 정신을 상기시키려는 국민 연맹의 노력은 성공적입니다. 이미 국가는 수십 년 동안 보지 못했던 희생, 근면에 대한 헌신, 차르 정부에 대한 신뢰의 증가를 관찰하고 있습니다."

 KIR_tsars_golden_purse_idea_desc:0 "차르 자신이 국가 산업 활동에 대한 개인적인 투자는 상당한 영향을 미쳤습니다. 재정적인 개선은 경제적 효율성과 산업 원재료 생산량을 직접적이고 눈에 띄게 증가 시켰습니다. 이것이 영원히 지속될 수는 없지만 가까운 장래에 예외적인 혜택입니다."

 KIR_return_of_the_tsar_desc:0 "이전의 군주들을 처형한 땅에 군주제 국가인 뱟카가 등장한 것은 서러시아 전쟁의 결과들 중 하나였습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 많은 사람들은 그것을 이해하지 못합니다.\n\n공산주의는 러시아를 완전히 폐퇴시켜 외국의 정권하에 굴복시켰고, 러시아가 자신에게 강요되는 것이 아니라 다른 사람들에게 자신의 의지를 강요하는 이전 시대로의 회귀는 매력적입니다.\n\n블라디미르 차르께서는 정기적으로 국민들을 공포에 떨게 하는 독일 폭격기들에 대한 국민들의 고통과 분노를 공유하면서 사람들에게 황제로서의 자질들을 보여주었습니다. 그리고 그는 머지않아 그들의 하늘이 해방되고, 땅이 개간되고, 볼가에서 아무르까지 자랑스럽게 전시된 제국 독수리를 보게 될 것이라고 맹세했습니다."

 KIR_an_economic_graveyard_desc:0 "모든 서러시아 전역에서 독일 루프트바페의 정기적인 폭격은 어떠한 규모의 경제도 유지할 수 없게 만듭니다. 공장과 유사했던 것이 발견되고, 타겟팅되고, 파괴됩니다. 이건 일부러 그런 겁니다. 독일은 우리가 산업화하는 것을 막을 수 있다면 우리가 단결하는 것을 막을 수 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.\n\n지금은 산업단지를 건설할 수 없을지 모르지만 그렇다고 해서 손놓고 놀고 있어야만 하는 것은 아닙니다. 우리는 가능한 한 많은 준비를 할 수 있습니다. 우리가 로마노프 왕조의 러시아를 되찾으려면 산업력이 있어야 합니다.\n\n언젠가는 폭격은 멈출것이며, 그들이 멈출때 우리는 준비를 할 것입니다."

 KIR_the_vyatka_distillery:0 "뱟카 증류소"
 KIR_the_vyatka_distillery_desc:0 "아주 많은 러시아인들은 질 좋은 보드카의 안정적인 공급은 식량을 섭취하는것 만큼이나 필수적인 것을 여깁니다. 전쟁과 독일의 폭격으로 인한 결과로, 그러한 제품들은 드물게 되었습니다. 그러나 그 속에서 차르께서 그것을 개발하려고 제안한 기회가 있습니다.\n\n감자를 대량으로 심고 경작해 영주들에게 식량과 고용, 원료들을 제공할 예정입니다. 증류소는 이러한 물질을 고품질의 보드카로 변형시키기 위해 재구성될 것이며, 고용을 증대하고, 국내 수요를 해결하며, 국가에 가치있고 매우 필요로하는 무역재를 공급할 것입니다. 러시아 전역에 보드카를 판매함으로써 얻는 수익은 다른 프로젝트에 자금을 댈 것이며, 모든 병이 팔리면, 한 명이라도 더 그들의 차르가 그들의 요구를 받아들인다는 것을 알게 될 것입니다."

 KIR_alternative_uses:0 "대안"
 KIR_alternative_uses_desc:0 "국가 증류소에서 생산되는 고품질 알코올은 무역에 매우 귀중하지만 효과적인 소독제로도 사용될 수 있습니다. 러시아에선 부상이 삶의 전부고 의료 인프라가 취약해서 이는 거의 비교할 수 없을 정도의 가치가 있습니다.\n\n우리의 새로운 증류소와 인접한 연구소를 건설함으로써, 생산된 보드카 일부를 의료용 소독제로 만들 수 있고, 우리의 민간 병원과 군병원에 안정적이고 꾸준한 공급을 제공할 수 있습니다. 우리는 비슷한 방식으로 그것의 일부를 수출, 무역 증가, 자본 창출, 그리고 아마도 러시아에서의 문명화 전투를 위해 쓸수도 있습니다."

 KIR_the_imperial_potato_act:0 "제국 감자법"
 KIR_the_imperial_potato_act_desc:0 "차르께서 추진한 증류산업 개발은 성공적이었습니다. 아주 성공적이죠. 고용이 증가하고 수출로 벌어들인 많은 재화들이 마침내 경제에 들어오기 시작했지만, 우리는 심각한 문제를 안고 있습니다. 국민들의 수요를 따라잡기엔 감자가 충분하지 않다는 것이죠. 우리는 즉각 행동을 취해야 합니다.\n\n해결책은 감자 경작지의 일정 비율로 주는것을 동의하는 농부들에겐 세금, 토지, 노동에 대한 보조금을 늘려주는 제국 감자법입니다.\n\n생산량이 증가하면 더 많은 보드카가 병으로 만들어질 것이고, 이것은 또한 우리가 수출하는 보드카의 양을 늘리기 시작할 수 있게 될 것입니다. 브르타뉴인, 프랑스인, 독일인, 그리고 더 많은 사람들이 가장 훌륭한 러시아 보드카가 뱟카에서 나온다는 것에 동의할 때까지 얼마 걸리지 않을 것입니다."

 KIR_find_new_markets:0 "새로운 시장 찾기"
 KIR_find_new_markets_desc:0 "최근 뱟카 증류소에 대한 최적화는 이전보다 훨씬 더 많은 생산으로 이어졌습니다. 우리는 도저히 용납할 수 없는 가격 인하 없이는 국내 또는 국내 해외 시장에서 모두 판매할 수 없습니다. 해결책은 멀리 있습니다.\n\n차르의 전 거주지인 브르타뉴는 최근 몇 년 동안 합법적이고 외부적인 무역의 중심지라는 정체성을 받아들였고, 이는 기회를 제공했습니다. 비록 판매량이 러시아와 같은 수준은 아니겠지만, 그들은 가격을 지키며 우리의 엄청난 비축량을 줄여줄 것이고, 많은 양의 재화들을 가져올 것입니다."

 KIR_rolling_on_the_river:0 "강 운영하기"
 KIR_rolling_on_the_river_desc:0 "강을 통해 운송하는 것은 오랫동안 러시아의 상업과 무역의 주축이였습니다. 강을 따라 이동하는 교통은 육로로 이동하는 것보다 훨씬 더 빠른 경우가 많은데, 러시아의 인프라 상태를 감안 할 때 현 시점에서는 두 배로 더 빠를 것입니다. 비록 우리가 더 이상 드네프르, 돈, 볼가와 같은 큰 강을 통제하진 않지만, 우리는 뱟카강을 통제하고, 그것은 서러시아를 가로지르는 다른 강들의 광대한 중심지로 연결됩니다.\n\n도시의 부두를 재개하고 강 바지선과 기타 무역선 건설을 촉진함으로써, 우리는 인프라를 보장받을 것이고 대내외적으로 무역을 늘릴 수 있습니다. 어쩌면 머지않아 뱟카 자체가 무역 중심지가 될 수도 있을 것입니다."

 KIR_the_kostroma_pipeline_desc:0 "브르타뉴와 안정된 무역 관계를 맺는 것이 매우 유익한게 입증되어, 우리는 다른 상품들 뿐만아니라 알코올의 과잉 생산을 떨쳐낼 수 있게 되었습니다. 하지만 브르타뉴는 너무 멀리 있고, 좋은것을 운반하는 것에는 큰 위험이 도사립니다.\n\n코스트로마는 독일과 경계에 위치한 자유도시로서 완벽하게 자리 잡고 있습니다. 다공성 국경선은 제국의 물건을 쉽게 수송할 수 있게 해주며, 독일인들은 더 이상 우리의 친구가 아니지만, 그들의 돈은 다른 사람들의 돈만큼 많습니다. 제국이 그럴 필요가 없을 만큼 강해질 때까지 우리는 그것을 가져갈 것입니다."

 KIR_a_new_hub_of_trade:0 "새 무역 중심지"
 KIR_a_new_hub_of_trade_desc:0 "무역을 장려하기 위한 우리의 노력은 매우 성공적입니다. 뱟카는 주요 무역 상품의 식별과 우선순위 결정, 국제 연결망 개발, 러시아 수로를 가로지르는 신속하고 효율적인 무역 중심지의 촉진으로 활동량이 폭발적으로 증가했습니다. 도시의 부두는 왁자지껄하고, 어느 때보다 큰 화물들이 움직이고 있으며, 수익은 매월 증가합니다. 그러나 차르와 그에게 조언하는 사람들은 항상 기대하고 있습니다.\n\n뱟카를 서러시아의 무역 중심지로 설립하는 방안이 제시돼 수용됐습니다. 기반시설은 크게 확장되어, 무역과 다른쪽의 산업도 확장 가능하게 했고, 도시로서의 뱟카의 미래가 보장되었으며, 다가올 캠페인의 강력한 재정 기반에 기여할 것입니다."

 KIR_imperial_austerity:0 "제국 긴축정책"
 KIR_imperial_austerity_desc:0 "공국의 경제 전반에 대한 감사 후에, 차르와 그의 장관들 모두 그것의 매우 노쇠한 상태를 알게 되어 충격을 받았습니다. 장인들이 지하 작업장에서 할 수 있는게 별로 없기 때문에 공장은 버려졌습니다. 또한 농부들이 자신과 가족을 먹여 살리기 위해 자급자족 농사에 주력함에 따라 밭이 나뒹굴고 있습니다. 조치를 취하지 않으면 우리의 취약한 경제는 곧 완전히 붕괴될 것입니다.\n\n이를 해결하기 위해 차르께서 긴축안을 상정했습니다. 서비스, 교육, 안전에 대한 심각한 삭감은 특히 이미 고통 받고 있는 많은 사람들에겐 고통스러울 것입니다. 그러나 우린 그게 필요합니다. 그리고 차르는 그것이 영원히 지속되지 않을 것임을 말하셨습니다."

 KIR_public_works_projects:0 "공공 사업 프로젝트"
 KIR_public_works_projects_desc:0 "두 번의 끔찍하고 악몽같았던 전쟁, 중앙 정부의 붕괴, 그리고 가치 있는 공장에 대한 독일의 정기적인 폭격은 그 이름에 걸맞은 어떤 러시아 기반 시설도 완전히 파괴하는 결과를 낳았습니다. 우리 국가와 다른 모든 곳에서, 일반 러시아인들은 대부분의 이동에서 현지 경로와 현지인에 의존합니다. 그것은 자연스럽게 무역, 산업 및 경제 발전, 그리고 군사력을 향상시킵니다.\n\n이를ㄹ 해결하기 위해 차르와 정부는 전역에 공공 사업 프로젝트의 자금을 지원하여 새로운 기반시설을 건설하고 옛것을 수리하는 동시에 일자리도 제공할 것입니다. 독일군은 물론 그것을 파괴할 것이지만, 우리는 어떠한 대가를 치르더라도 지원할 것입니다. 미래가 그것을 요구하니깐요."

 KIR_imperial_bank_of_russia:0 "러시아 제국 은행"
 KIR_imperial_bank_of_russia_desc:0 "러시아의 산업 경제 붕괴는 믿을 만한 은행 시스템의 붕괴를 같이 불러왔습니다. 그에 대한 결과로, 눈에 띄는 투자나 신용의 완전한 부재, 통화에 대한 신뢰 부족, 귀금속 사재기로의 회귀, 시민들 사이의 물물교환 기반 경제가 발전했습니다.\n\n공공사업과 긴축 프로그램이 정착되면서 다음 단계는 중앙은행 창설을 통해 이 중대한 문제를 바로잡는 것입니다. 그러한 창설은 우리 화폐의 합법화, 신뢰 증진, 정책 수립에 도움이 될 것입니다. 더 나아가 상업 및 민간 대출 기관의 자극과 규제를 허용하여 모든 부문에서 경제 성장을 장려 할 것입니다.

 KIR_more_extreme_measures:0 "더 극단적인 조치"
 KIR_more_extreme_measures_desc:0 "차르와 그의 정부는 경제 붕괴를 막기 위해 긴축 정책이 필요하다는 데 동의하고 있습니다. 그러나 그것이 이미 수년간의 고통을 견뎌낸 우리 민족에게 미칠 영향도 고려해야 합니다. 긴축조치의 강도에 대한 결정은 차르에 의해 결정 됐습니다.\n\n그리고 그는 어려운 선택을 했습니다. 인프라, 의료, 사회 프로그램 등은 국가 재정을 확립하고 향후 영토 개척에 대한 우리의 설계에 보조금을 제공하기 위해 뼈째로 깎을 것입니다. 사람들은 행복하지 않을 것입니다. 하지만 때가 되면 그들은 차르가 자신의 미래만큼이나 국민들의 미래를 계획하고 있다는 것을 알게 될 것입니다."

 KIR_divert_funds_to_the_military:0 "자금을 군대로 돌리기"

Well, if smuggling alcohol out of Russia is their goal, they could hardly have picked better people to do it. The only question is whether or not we will accept the deal.\n\nThe Emperor's men drive a hard bargain: since the end of the Second World War, Russian-brewed vodka has been in short supply in the West. Indeed, the very first shipment received will probably pay itself back several times over. Collaboration with one of the only vestiges of monarchism in Russia would also serve to ingratiate ourselves with White émigrés, many of whom sit upon large piles of cash. The opportunities that trade with Vyatka could present to us are numerous, but so are the risks.\n\nBesides the resources that will be needed to establish the route, our greatest problem will be getting the vodka across Europe in the first place - a treacherous journey through German-occupied territory and the banditry that plagues Russia. Even as few as a dozen crates being lost per month could substantially cut into our profits. There is also the issue of the general instability of Russia as a whole. Vyatka could easily cease to exist in half a decade, and our relations with them would hardly endear us to whoever takes their place.\n\nWith all of this in mind, should we accept the Emperor's offer with a handshake, or politely turn it down and search for better opportunities?

As its members arrived, they spoke quietly amongst themselves. The Tsar had made it clear that he wanted to deal with the myriad internal issues facing the Sovereignty before any talk of further unification would be countenanced, and political jockeying had already begun.\n\nAs the Tsar arrived and the meeting commenced, one member proposed to focus state efforts on infrastructure, while another wished to focus on internal security, and others wanted attentions placed elsewhere besides. By the time the meeting finished, several hours later, some progress, less than was hoped but more than was feared, had been made on several of those issues.\n\nLater that evening, Vladimir thought on the events of earlier. There were differing opinions, and arguments, and debates of all kinds in between. But all were dedicated to the Sovereignty, to him, and to preparing the country for its ultimate goal of eastwards unification, regardless of personal interest.\n\nHe would accept that."

I have heard, as you have, the calls for democracy increase day-by-day, and I do not believe that modern Russia can endure the rigid autocracy of my ancestors."\n\nGul, the eternal reformer, spoke first. "Majesty," he said, his eyes shining and a smile spreading across his face, "this is excellent news, and most heartening besides. The people will deeply respect this choice. But-"\n\n"When will it happen?" Solzhenitsyn interrupted, his own eyes narrowing.\n\n"As soon as we are secure." Vladimir gestured above himself. "With the end of the bombing raids the generals have told me that it is imperative we move quickly to secure the region, before others do the same. As soon as that is achieved, the congress will be called." There was more said, but the most important message had been conveyed.\n\nAs the three men left the room, Shulgin hesitated before closing the door behind himself, and spoke. "Majesty, I wanted to thank you. What you have said here today has helped an old man have confidence that his life of dedication has not been wasted."\n\nAlone again, Vladimir looked out his window.

Council meetings that ended in shouting matches between his advisors. Reports of military discontent and confusion. Even perhaps, the Tsar thought, punishment from God for his many sins. He wasn't even free from them while sleeping anymore.\n\nWhen he had first marched into Vyatka all those years ago, he could not have imagined that things would be this way. He had grown on stories about the wonders of the monarchy and the power of the Tsar. He now knew them to be lies. His government was divided, his army was paralyzed, and his people were deprived. And very often he felt as if he had no power at all, an observer along for the ride.\n\nBut those stories of glory and power had always been accompanied by very serious talks of duty. He had a duty to his people and to Russia, and those simply could not be abandoned, no matter how much he sometimes wanted to leave and return to Brittany or somewhere farther afield.\n\nHe was the Tsar, and he had his duty.\n\nWhich, for now at least, involved rousing from bed and preparing for the day."

Pulling up to the gate, the driver would smile at the guards and, when handing over his identification and manifest, would also include an envelope.\n\nThe guards would then inspect the papers and manifest and return them, the envelope having somehow disappeared. They would then open the gate, and the truck would drive through, it being trusted that the goods on the manifest were in fact the goods in the truck.\n\nYes, being a border guard meant consigning oneself to low pay and mind-numbing periods of inactivity.

Encompassing beliefs from across the political spectrum, some quite radical, many struggle to understand its, and by extension his, ideology and ultimate ambitions.\n\nDespite this, he was a loyal follower of the Tsar during the West Russian War, and following it was rewarded with the governorship of Berezniki. Berezniki, a frontier territory surrounded by radicals, was eventually pacified by Kazembek and his followers, and despite all likelihoods to the contrary the territory, now a viceroyalty of the Mladorossi, has both survived and thrived.\n\nIndeed, reports from the Tsar's representative, Boris Skosyrev, have described both significant industrial developments as well as the sustainable exploitation of local natural resources. These resources, including critical oil and petroleum products, are regularly dispatched back to the Principality, under the careful political supervision of Kazembek himself. Thus, he is crucial both to maintaining peace in and delivering resources from the region, and as long as he does that, carefully supervised by Skosyrev, he will maintain his position.\n\nDespite this, however, suspicion from members of our government towards Kazembek continues, and many say that his resource deliveries will continue only until he sees an opportunity to fully divorce himself from the Tsar's authority. For now, though, Kazembek's true motives remain unclear."

And that day had now come. The Okhrana's report, and warning, on Kazembek's imminent display of disloyalty had arrived by special messenger less than an hour ago. Far too late to do any good. But just long enough to allow him to burn everything of value.\n\nHe signed. Kazembek had never been an agreeable choice as governor. His belief in the syncretism of monarchist ideals with communist influences was not only laughable, but also a starting point from which today's ending was inevitable. He just hoped that the Tsar would be able to reclaim the rogue territory before the religious fanatics to the north or the ideological fanatics to the south moved to claim it.\n\nTurning away from the soldiers, Skosyrev tossed one last document into the fire beside him, hefted his pack, and checked the rifle by the door. He might not have wanted to see this day, but he had planned for it. A route through the forest had been scouted, and a boat by the river concealed. If he was lucky, he would reach the border with Vyatka shortly, and if he was luckier, he would be permitted to accompany the army on its return to Berezniki.\n\nSkosyrev smiled at the thought.

The crime itself was not particularly rare in Russia, and was typically the responsibility of the ordinary police. Yevgeny was the first to arrive, and it took him only a few moments after proving to the suddenly skittish police officers who he was to understand why he had been called. Arriving later, Valentin understood similarly quickly.\n\nThe existence of a revolutionary cell, dedicated to the overthrow of the Tsar, had recently been discovered. The dead man, an official from the Ministry of Finance, had had his name flagged in connection to it, and having been assigned to the task force looking into the cell, they both knew, immediately, that there had to be a connection. Why this man had been killed, and by who, was still unclear.\n\nBut to do so was an enormous risk on the part of the cell, and there had to have been a reason. A reason that could be identified, understood, and followed. A reason that could, in time, lead them to the resources and connections of the cell, and thereby destroy them."
 KIR.31.a:0 "This could be more important than it seems."

 KIR.32.t:0 "Investigating the Leads"
 KIR.32.desc:0 "Valentin and Yevgeny began their investigation by searching the house where the body had been found. Following the training they had been given by Smyslovsky's instructors, they first moved to determine the place and instrument of death. That, at least, proved simple.\n\nThe man had been shot from behind in the kitchen by, judging from the wound, a small caliber pistol. The casing was bagged and would be examined to determine the type and origin of the gun. The next step was to look for evidence that might connect the man to the cell, in order to trove the suspicions of him that had arisen before his death.\n\nThis was similarly found in a box of letters. Amongst the many sent to the man from family and friends, one stood out. Sent by "Kachestvennaya Dostavka," an import/export company that operated throughout Western Russia, it indicated that the man had been involved in moving unspecified cargo for them in and out of the industrial city of Izhevsk.\n\nAnother such letter indicated that he had recently facilitated the purchase of a small warehouse for the company here Vyatka itself, and had specifically ensured that it was in a lesser-traveled part of the city. Both were promising leads, but the agents had to choose which to follow themselves."

Inside, the cavernous space was mostly empty, and so the agents began searching the office for shipment records.\n\nIt did not take long for them to discover a lead. Amongst the many mundane manifests, a series of shipments between the Kachestvennaya Dostavka warehouse and locations in Izhvesk were found, all facilitated by the same man - Koronovanny Byrukho.\n\nAlthough the agents suspected the name to false, after noticing it in several other documents they retreated to the Okhrana offices to pour through official records. Before long, they discovered it again - in a register of addresses. Without delay, they set out to find the man with the strange name."

 KIR.34.desc:0 "The residence of "Koronovannyy Bryukho" was anything but. The small house, though well-kept on the outside, was nearly bare inside, containing only the most bare necessities and little else. To the trained eyes of Valentin and Yevgeny, this meant one of two things. Either the man was an extreme ascetic or, more likely, this was a safe house.\n\nLeveraging their training and experience, they began searching the house for clues, physical or otherwise, and it did not take long before they found a well-concealed false floor panel. Underneath, a ladder descended into a crudely excavated cellar, and inside they found what they had come for.\n\nOn a desk covered in maps and folders, one in particular stood out. Stamped 'Confidential - Plan Eagle,' the papers inside the folder seemed to describe an upcoming sabotage operation against an industrial plant in Izhevsk, using materials shipped from the warehouse they had investigated earlier. Knowing time was of the essence, the agents gathered up the folders and returned to the Okhrana headquarters. They needed to report to Smyslovsky immediately."

Amongst them, none were more important than the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, and as Valentin and Yevgeny arrived in the city, they knew that if the plot did extend here, the plant was likely to be at least one of its targets.\n\nThe link between the deceased official from the Ministry of Finance and Izhevsk was one that had to be pursued, regardless of any other obtained information, and so the agents spent their day investigating every associate the man had had in the city. Other Ministry agents were gently interviewed, companies he had worked with were contacted, and offices he had worked in searched, all to no success.\n\nHowever, there remained several specific factories that had been identified in his letters, and which could still be explored. Perhaps additional leads could be found there."

And, just like all the others, careful searches of its records had turned up nothing of interest. That changed, very suddenly, when an enormous explosion rocked the building, heaving the floor to one side and throwing the agents down to it.\n\nKnowing that the timing of the explosion was too perfect to be a coincidence, and further knowing how fortunate they truly were to be on site at the time of it, rather than arriving after the fact, the agents scrambled to recover. Running against the crowds of workers, and towards the site of the explosion, Yevgeny spotted a figure standing nearby. A figure that appeared all too calm.\n\nCalling out to Valentin, Yavgeny drew his weapon and rushed towards the figure. He knew, in the way that only an investigator can, that the figure was involved. He would not let it escape."

Joining one of the teams themselves, the agents found themselves watching one such factory, the primary target listed in the plan discovered in Vyatka.\n\nWith long-developed and well-practiced skills of surveillance, it was not long before Yevgeny first saw the figure first approaching, and then entering, the factory. Moving quickly, Yevgeny, Valentin, and the support team followed. As Yevgeny approached the figure, he realized that it was attaching a device to one of the factory's fuel tanks, and drew his sidearm while calling out a challenge. The figure immediately took off running.\n\nAs Yevgeny and Valentin began to give chase, the local agents moved to take care of the device, and Yevgeny gave thanks that the agents had been there to assist. He didn't want to think about what might have happened had they not been."
 KIR.37.a:0 "Catch him!"

 KIR.38.desc:0 "Noticing Yevgeny's approach, the figure had taken off running through the factory complex, using the myriad pipes, machines, and other obstructions to break line of sight and attempt escape. But if the figure thought such would work, he had clearly never been chased by the Okhrana.\n\nChasing the figure across a floor, through an emergency door, and down the stairwell beyond, Yevgeny was able to, for the first time, catch a good look at his quarry. The man was young, probably not out of his twenties, and clearly very physically fit besides. Fit enough that he was pulling ahead of the agent.\n\nAs Yevgeny emerged into the cold Izhvesk air, Valentin following closely behind, he knew that he would have to make a decision as to the best way to catch the likely saboteur."

 KIR.39.desc:0 "Hoping that he had made the right choice, Yevgeny quickly instructed Valentin on what to do as he resumed his pursuit of the saboteur. Unfortunately however, and although he pushed his body to the limit, the saboteur continued to pull ahead.\n\nAs they approached the exit to the factory grounds, the saboteur grew even more distant. Yevgeny realized he had a clear shot and, knowing that it was preferable to eliminate an enemy agent if escape could not be prevented, slowed to better his aim, firing three times a moment later.\n\nOne shot found its mark, striking the saboteur in the shoulder, but before he could fire again the figure, after several stumbling steps, disappeared into shadow. Yevgeny cursed as Valentin stopped beside him, equally angry.\n\nBoth agents knew that they would mobilize the city's officers to try and find the saboteur, and both knew it was unlikely to lead to an arrest. Already the saboteur would be executing an escape plan, and within hours would be deep in the Russian forests, if not in the territory of another power altogether.\n\nYevgeny and Valentin looked at each other, sharing a grimace. This was a major defeat."

But, just like those others, they had always believed it would not happen to them.\n\nTheir superior heard their recounting of events. How they had been on the scene during the Izhvesk attack. How they had detected the saboteur. And then how, unforgivably, they had allowed that saboteur to escape, robbing the Okhrana of the opportunity to interrogate them and discover other members of the cell. They were dismissed soon after\n\nIt took several days before the decision was actually made, but all knew what it would be. The services of Yevgeny and Valentin would no longer be needed. They had proven themselves unable to protect the Tsar and his nation, and the Okhrana did not tolerate failures in its ranks.\n\nNow civilians, the agents would need to find a new purpose in life. A purpose that did not involve a world of secrecy and intrigue. They had shown that they did not have the skill for it."

A major attack, an attempt by a foreign-sponsored, anti-government cell to destabilize the Tsar's country had been detected and defeated. But the saboteur had escaped, and with them went any chance the Okhrana had of further penetrating, and thus defeating the cell itself. The Okhrana was not known for being kind to those who did not complete their missions to the fullest, a classification Yevgeny and Valentin found now applied to them.\n\nThey would not, despite their achievements, be acknowledged as respected defenders of the nation. No, they would be reassigned to desk jobs in a regional office, far away from capital or any investigations of importance.\n\nThey would still serve the Tsar, of course, but in a manner more befitting of their 'skills.'"
 KIR.41.a:0 "The Okhrana does not suffer fools."

 KIR.42.t:0 "The Saboteur Caught"
 KIR.42.desc:0 "Hoping that he had made the right choice, Yevgeny quickly instructed Valentin on what to do as he resumed his pursuit of the saboteur. As Yevgeny pushed himself and his body to the limit, the saboteur tried to create obstructions behind him to slow the agent down. That was a mistake.\n\nAs he ran, Yevgeny heard, in his mind, the voice of Smyslovsky cursing out another agent for doing the same thing. Trying to do so only slowed you down, he would say, and often did little to hinder pursuit. As such, and despite the obvious difference in physicality, he found himself gaining on the saboteur. He realized he had a clear shot, if he had wanted it.\n\nBut he, they, needed the man alive. He was their connection, their next link in the cell's chain. He could not be allowed to get away. And, as they approached an exit to the factory's grounds, Yevgeny saw that he would not. Suddenly appearing in front of him through herculean effort, Valentin barreled into the saboteur, knocking him flat and pinning him onto the ground.\n\nAs Yevgeny rushed forward and pressed his pistol to the saboteur's head, Valentin prepared restraints. They found themselves smiling at each other. This was a major victory."
 KIR.42.a:0 "He will talk. They always do, eventually."

 KIR.43.t:0 "Moderate Success for the Okhrana"
 KIR.43.desc:0 "The day after the factory explosion, it was important news. A terrible accident, the rough newspapers and static-filled radio stations proclaimed. But what was to the public an accident was a far more serious affair to the Okhrana.\n\nThe successful capture, and subsequent interrogation, of the saboteur allowed the Izhvesk Case, as it became known, to become the foundation by which the Okhrana moved against the revolutionary cell that had been identified some time previously. As a an agent of the cell, now known to be comprised of both infiltrators from the Revolutionary Front along with local communist and socialist dissidents, he was able to offer insight into its activities as well as identifying information about his direct contacts.\n\nAs a result of their quick actions in Izhvesk, Yevgeny and Valentin, together with many other loyal agents, were able to, in short order, make a number of additional arrests and work their way further up the chain. Before long, the ability of the cell to conduct operations was crippled, and though several members of it escaped, its ability to act as a serious threat to the Tsar's regime was destroyed.\n\nThus, despite the failure to halt the attack in Izhvesk, the Okhrana saw the overall result as a victory for themselves, for the Tsar, and for the integrity of monarchism as an institution."

Evidenced by their rapid, decisive, and successful action, clearly few were more skilled at providing that defense than the Okhrana.\n\nThe Izhvesk case, as it became known, was later used as a textbook example of exceptional fieldcraft. Yevgeny and Valentin had acted, using both training and intuition, to rapidly pursue the leads obtained from investigating the deceased official. In so doing, they not only prevented a serious terrorist attack at a critical manufacturing facility, but also captured the would-be saboteur for interrogation.\n\nInterrogation that soon led to the arrests of others, members all of an experienced and dedicated subversive cell. The destruction of which did much to protect the state while simultaneously blinding and blunting the efforts of its enemies.\n\nThe agents themselves were richly, if covertly given the classified nature of the entire operation, rewarded. Both elevated in rank, they worked to shape their respective departments, increasing their efficiency and skill at defending the state and, through such efforts, the Tsar himself."

 KIR.45.desc:0 ""Wetwork" was the term used for a number of the many less-savory tasks that the Okhrana was responsible for. Thus, becoming both skilled at wetwork, whatever it may be, and even better at keeping the confidence of just what was done was the primary method of acquiring the capital needed for internal advancement. This was a system that Yevgeny and Valentin did use, and had used, to great effect in their careers.\n\nSometimes the tasks were simple. Intercepting communications, raiding suspected safe-houses, interrogating denounced dissidents, and the like. Sometimes they were not. Sometimes men had to be found, run to ground, and delivered to their superiors, whatever the collateral damage to the families or friends of their quarry. Almost to a one, those men were never seen again.\n\nYes, the Okhrana valued efficiency, and Yevgeny and Valentin had mastered the art of being so, through training, practice, and long hours of actual work. What else could one call the feat of securing the critical lead in an offensive against a foreign-sponsored insurrectionist cell?\n\nWith every task completed, with every enemy neutralized, Yevgeny and Valentin advanced just that much higher in the Okhrana's hierarchy, their ultimate aim to serve and protect the Tsar, no matter the cost or consequences."

As the candles took the light, and as the sun began to set, shadows began to dance around the room. The two points of light in front of him became blazing towers, calling him to prayer before the eyes of the Lord - and before the day of rest began.\n\n"Blessed are You, Lord our God," he began, drawing his breath deep and closing his eyes, "King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to light the Shabbat candles."\n\nThe Sabbath had begun, but Yakov did not open his eyes.

Much worse.\n\nAs they moved to surround him, he moved to walk away, but for the first time one of them grabbed his shoulder. Tightly. By the time he let go, Yakov was surrounded. And then the insults began, and Yakov grew scared. This time, they not only came faster but were also more screamed than spoken.\n\nOne of the men, a well-known scion of an uptown family that was close to the Tsar, withdrew a strip of bacon from his pocket and offered it to Yakov, only to watch him shake his head in reply.\n\nAnother of the thugs laughed. "Boris," he began, speaking to the scion, "I think the dirty Jew doesn't value your generosity." Before Yakov could speak, could try to deny the man's words, Boris had pulled a club from his belt and swung. As Yakov fell to the ground, clutching his head in pain, the rest of the men withdrew their own clubs and began swinging as well.\n\nWhen they had finished, and begun searching his body for gold, rubles, or other valuables, Yakov was unconscious. Those on the street did not intervene, scared of the influence of Boris' family.\n\nBut from a discrete corner, however, a camera captured the scene and the faces of the perpetrators.

The connection between the young man's father and himself was being spoken about more and more, and Vladimir knew he had to take action, and quickly. When he said as much, the young man's eyes went wide.\n\n"Sire," he began, voice trembling, "I know I have caused you both injury and concern. But I beg you to grant mercy. If not for my sake, then for my father's, who fought with you all the way from Brittany to your palace here." He swung an arm towards the window. "Our family has always been supportive of the crown, and if you grant mercy I pledge that my father, and I after him, will always be indebted to you, regardless of need. Please, majesty, do not let the matter of one Jew undo all that we have done for you."\n\nVladimir considered his words for a long moment. He had to show contrition for the injured man, of course. But Mozhayev's family was influential, and to make enemies of them, after so many years of loyalty, could inspire others to ask if their own long loyalties would be similarly treated so poorly. After a moment, he spoke.\n\n"Fine. I will be merciful. This time. It will not happen again. And now you may leave. We are busy."

In the Russia I remember from childhood, nobody would have even considered protesting for the rights of a Jew."\n\n"Times are different now," the Tsar replied sharply. "Clearly."\n\nGul nodded.

Even if things could have perhaps been handled better at the start, I, we, know that you will do the right thing."\n\nGul opened the door again and, with a quick bow, stepped outside, leaving the Tsar with his thoughts, the sounds of the crowd outside, and his migraine.

Some of the functionaries began to move about. "And then," he continued, "schedule interviews with their primary competitors. We need to get our side of the story out."\n\nTo the staff arrayed around him, Gul projected confidence. But inside his own mind, he knew there would be no victory here. The allegations were out, their damage already done. And further claims were already being made.\n\nThe Tribune, along with many other anti-governmental publications that had coalesced around it, had begun publishing stories about the Tsar's family. About other aspects of his character. About Gul himself, once he was thrust into the maelstrom.\n\nHe knew that, eventually, he would be able to stop the flow of negative press. Every newspaper required access to the government to function as anything other than a seditious newsletter, and the Tribune was no exception. They would learn that in short order.

Then it was his history in Brittany. And then it was his response to those events themselves! If it had not been for the loyal service of Roman Gul, Vladimir did not think he would have made it through. But the councillor had shown his dedication, and given him good advice, besides. Advice that now rested on his desk.\n\nHe had written a personal letter to Yakov Rivkin. He had spoken of his failures, of his regrets, and he had humbly offered compensation while asking the man for forgiveness. It would get out and be reprinted, of course, and he would be again hounded for his attempts at mitigation. His attempts at concealment.

As your sovereign, we apologize in the name of our crown, as well as for the callous letter, not written in our hand, that we sent without serious thought.\n\nIn the time since we have vacillated between denouncing the hatred that harmed you and protecting our own position, and we would like to apologize, in the same fashion as above, for the same.\n\nWe also realize that our apology will likely have little meaning to you unless accompanied by action. We will therefore take it. For you and your family, we shall compensate for whatever loss was incurred by the attack.

For all the Jews in our Empire, we shall denounce the hatred that has, for so long, harmed their livelihood and survival.\n\nOur trusted advisor, Roman Gul, had implored us since the beginning to do the 'right thing.' A nebulous concept for a monarch, who must not dwell in the morals of their actions, indeed.\n\nHowever, I dedicate this last paragraph to you, not as your Tsar, but as one person to another. I do not know if you will find this letter sufficient, but if you will allow me the opportunity to redeem my past actions I promise, in the presence of the God we both venerate in different ways, that I will try.\n\nSigned, Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov."

She had cared for him when no-one else would, and when he had told her of his plans, she had asked to come. An angel sent by God.\n\nThe journey to their new home, wherever it might be, would be long and dangerous. But Yakov was not scared. He had kept faith with God for so many years, and God had kept faith with him in return. Though he would have liked to remain.\n\nThe callous, curt letter that the Tsar had sent came to mind. Yakov understood, and indeed believed, that the Tsar himself held no hatred for him or his people. But the court had made it clear that antisemitism was still alive and well amongst Russians.

In his mind, if he could do so, if he could show the people an alternative to instability and strife and a pathway to greatness, he could help promote the eventual restoration of the Tsar's authority over all of Russia.\n\nAfter hours of review, Shulgin inspected his document one final time. A proud declaration of the resilience of the Russian people and the glory of monarchism, it would no doubt bolster the morale of the Principality's citizens.

Indeed, others are being galvanized to action.\n\nOne of these others is the Tsar himself, who has read numerous reports about a sudden surge in interest in scientific pursuits, aeronautical engineering, and other elements of higher education among the populace.

Shoddy pre-war fighters were piloted by undertrained airmen that seemed only seconds away from crashing into one another at any given time. It was a miracle they had managed to get so many planes in the air without a disaster.\n\nStill, even as Vladimir's fingers dug into the arm of his chair, he could not deny the beauty he saw in their potential.

In fort building, that meant using old Soviet installations. If there wasn't concrete available, you looked for solid stones. If the stones weren't stable, wood made up the rest. And when there was nothing left but dirt, trenches were dug and lined with bags full of the very same soil.\n\nTheir current project was a sight better than when they had first arrived.

No. The gunman was wrestled to the ground. A dozen men surrounded the Tsar. But not Stepan. Where was Stepan?\n\nIn that moment Vladimir knew whose blood stained his clothes."

The old soldier's funeral was a grand affair, a public event that saw the streets of Vyatka swell with mourners. Soldiers lined the roads, guarding the carriage-led procession on its journey to the Imperial Residence.\n\nVladimir knew he was expected to speak at the end of the procession. But all he could think about were the moments that should have been his last. The pops. The screaming. The blood. Stepan's blood. A noble man that had searched over four decades to serve the rightful Tsar. A brave man that had died only months after he found what he was looking for. What could be said about him that would do justice to such a soul? What could be said that was not already clear by his deeds? In the brief time Vladimir had known Stepan Novikov, there was one immutable tenet that guided him -- service. Service to his Tsar, to his Motherland, to its people. He gave his all to what he believed in.\n\nAs the funeral procession drew closer, Vladimir walked to the edge of his balcony. He saw the rain beating down on buildings with leaky roofs and walls without enough insulation. He saw hundreds of soldiers marching in jackets that were too thin with rifles that were too old. He saw thousands of men and women following them with worn out shoes and empty stomachs. He saw the future of Russia. He saw Vyatka. He saw a country in need of service. A country that he would serve.\n\nVladimir stood at the podium and prepared to speak."

The doors to his study swung open as the three most powerful men in Vyatka strode into the room. Solzhenitsyn had, thankfully, quieted upon entering the room. They greeted the Tsar and took their seats.\n\n"Welcome gentlemen, I thank you all for coming," the Tsar began. With the usual pleasantries out of the way, Vladimir spoke again. "As you all are well aware, we are poised to begin the reclamation of Russia within the coming months. However, if we are to have any chance of success in this coming trial, we must go forth as a united front. The traitors and cultists that surround us will use any sign of division among us to bring about our demise. I implore each of you, set aside your differences for the time being. All of our efforts must be towards the pacification and unification of Russia."\n\nFor a moment he could see hints of surprise on their faces, unused as they were to the firm tone he used. Roman was the first to find his voice, "I am sure I speak for us all when I say that we would be happy to put aside our differences for the betterment of Russia." Shulgin and Solzhenitsyn nodded as he spoke, though Solzhenistyn seemed reluctant to do so. "However, my Tsar, we all understand that the status quo is unsustainable in the long run. There must be some resolution once West Russia is in our hands."\n\nVladimir nodded in agreement, "I agree. When the wars for West Russia are over, we must finally decide the future of the Empire."

Even when he was just a farm hand, the military rarely came around and only to collect taxes or clear bandits. In the city, they acted as more of a police force, but they still weren't rigid to the bone. Now, they were a true, disciplined army.\n\nHe had heard from some of his friends that the factories were being shifted to focus on military production. Propaganda leaflets and radio ads could be seen and heard throughout the city, encouraging young men like him to join. Dimitri had no interest in this, for he wished to live. After all, he had seen the end of the bombings he had had to learn to deal with all his life, he wasn't going to die now after they had just stopped dropping the bombs.\n\nHowever, he also knew what this meant for the city. Vytaka was out in the open and easy to attack. Bandits had not tried to attack the city due to their disorganization and the defenses of the city, but Vytaka did not plan on going agaisnt bandits. No, the Tsar wished to go to war with his enemies in the name of restoring his hold over all of Russia. That meant that the city would go under martial law, and the army would protect the city against any foe. He worried that the city may even become a battleground, blown to shreds by artillery shells.\n\nBut there was no point in worrying himself over what could happen, for it would bode well for his mind. His mother always did say the mind was sometimes the greatest enemy of a man, and she was right. He had to keep working, for if he didn't, who knows what would happen.

Indeed, it was the Tsar who appointed Kazembek as governor of Berezniki and permitted him to continue to grow the Mladorossi movement there.\n\nAlthough relations broke down some time ago, and Kazembek separated us from the central government in Vyatka, it would appear that the Tsar is determined for his authority to return to Berezniki, one way or another.\n\nWhile we are willing to fight, the Tsar's army is much larger and better equipped than our own, and so the offer for Kazembek and the Tsar to meet and discuss terms was a welcome one. If we can extract concessions and protections from the Tsar, even as we agree to rejoin his state, we can continue to spread our beliefs in peace and security.\n\nMany senior figures in the movement have expressed support for the talks, and the only thing remaining is to see if Kazembek, whose voice carries more weight than all others combined, agrees as well."

He knew that his actions had been right, regardless of where he now found himself. The people of his country needed emancipation from the regimes they found themselves crushed by, and that emancipation would not come at the hands of a Tsar, just as it would not come at the hands of a communist. It would come from what he had strived for: something in between. Unfortunately, Russia was simply not yet ready to hear it.\n\nAs the judge proclaimed his sentence - lifetime imprisonment - Kazembek held his head high. He knew he was right.

He was a caring figure, but that care was tempered with the detachment necessary of a man who had to make momentous decisions. And he was no ardent supporter of the monarchy. At least not yet.\n\nAs talks continued, the real question was soon asked - what would the Tsar have to do to ensure the peaceful integration of the Order into his realm? Antipin replied immediately, clearly having prepared a response long in advance.\n\nTo the south, in and around Perm, lay the lands of the Aryan 'Brotherhood,' a fanatic and clearly insane sect, and one that had long troubled both the Tsar and those protected by the Order. If the Tsar wanted to prove his piety to both God and the Order, if he wanted to prove his dedication to the common people of Russia, he would have to exterminate this abomination, root and stem.\n\nTsar Vladimir carefully considered Antipin's words.

How else could he have made the choice to invade the lands of the Order, sack the Fortress-Monastery, and kill so many of Daniil's fellow monks?\n\nDanill had spent most of his young life in the order, believing absolutely in its holy mission to protect the weak and downtrodden from the jackals that surrounded them. But he had failed. They had failed. And now when he spoke to God, he didn't hear anything in response except the screams of his brothers as the soldiers shot them down.\n\nBut he was still alive, and he would avenge them. It was a long way to Vyatka, through hard terrain and even harder soldiers. But he would make it. He knew he would. He shifted as he felt the rifle dig into his side.

A tattered flag bearing the hooked cross and weighted tricolour of the Aryan Brotherhood.\n\nFurious that such an icon of blasphemy had been brought to his lands, the Grandmaster only paused when the officer smiled wide. "You don't understand, Grandmaster," he said, eyes twinkling, "this was the first flag of the Brotherhood. Taken from their 'Fyurer's' personal quarters. They're defeated."\n\nAs quick as his rage had formed, it had subsided, and Antipin quickly snatched the flag and tossed into a nearby fire. As it burned, he gave thanks to God that the jackals had been defeated by one so righteous as Tsar Vladimir, and he gave the officer the response he knew the man wanted.\n\nThe Tsar had proven himself worthy, and so the Order of Saint George would join him, for the good of all Russia."

Stunned, overwhelmed, Vadim stood still, frozen in place. Until, from the highest tower, the one the guards used as a sniper's nest, the flag bearing the hated swastika was cut down, and the tricolour of the Imperial state was unfurled.\n\nVadim fell to his knees, his muscles suddenly weak, and tears streamed down his face.

But still the gunshots continued. Gathering a small party of soldiers, he moved towards the sounds, and as he grew closer his heart began to sink.

A party of the Royalist Guard had rounded up a group of citizens and, after short 'interrogations,' executing them.\n\nStorming forward, he demanded a stop to the shootings, and further demanded to know what was going on. The commander just smiled and showed him a pass signed by the city's military governor. The captives were socialists, he said, members and saboteurs of the Revolutionary Front, and he was simply taking care of them.\n\nMikhail could see he had no power here. Were the captives truly socialists? Truly saboteurs? Or were they simply political enemies from the old Republic? Or personal enemies? An order to return to base came over his radio, and with one last look at the terrified captives, he obeyed.\n\nMikhail had once thought that using collaborators meant there would be less bloodshed.

The Tsar knew that there were personal reasons for the suggestion as well - after all, many of the captured officers had once served alongside his own during the West Russian War - but there was genuine merit. Many of the generals were truly very skilled.\n\nThe suggestion was fiercely protested by other generals. Unlike both they and the Tsar himself, the men had not abandoned collaboration with the Germans until forced to do so, and they had generally fascist leanings besides. Vladimir faced a dilemma.

And in the government he could both preach Mladorossi-influenced solutions to national problems and also identify sympathetic politicians and officials.\n\nMany officials are, unsurprisingly, critical of the suggestion to give a senior government position to one that they see as both a radical and a traitor, while others see it as a necessary concession towards the state's unification plans for Western Russia. Kazembek is no fool, and if this concession is granted prior to the Tsar's meeting with him, he will not accept a cabinet post without significant influence.\n\nThus, the central question has become whether we will accept the leader of the Mladorossi as an influential figure of our government in exchange for a decisive end to the crisis surrounding his rogue governorate."

But the outcome was never in doubt. It could not be.\n\nAs the sentences were read out, the revolutionaries looked on, stone-faced.

Following that, he took the time to meet with the soldiers nominated for awards, and taking over responsibility from the unit commander, personally conveyed the awards to those so nominated, with pictures taken all the while.\n\nBy the time he left, later that evening, many of the battalions soldiers seemed more confident, more focused, and more determined to complete their mission.\n\nThe visit was considered a great success, not only among the troops themselves, but also in how the public began to see their Tsar - as a man willing to leave his palace and meet those actually fighting for him, in stark contrast to many of the Romanovs of old."

Three parties have risen to offer their electoral platforms.\n\nThe Constitutional-Democrats, better known as the 'Kadets' and led by Roman Gul, have pledged to run on a platform of liberalization and reform, continuing the development of constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe All-Russian National Union, led by Vasily Shulgin, are expected to run on a much more conservative platform, with a focus on returning to the values and organizational structure of the old Empire, with a strong Tsar at its head.\n\nThe National Union of Solidarists, led by Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn, promises national strength and security, of a Russian state secured for Russians under an empowered central government.\n\nThough none can be sure which party will prove victorious, all can agree that the outcome of the Congress will be extremely influential in shaping the direction of the revived Imperial state."

They promise regional autonomy, the respect of cultural and religious tradition, and the liberalization of the Tsar's regime, believing that to do so would create a state that all could be proud to be part of.\n\nThe Conservatives, under the leadership of the old Imperial bureaucrat Vasily Shulgin, promised a return to the values of the Russian Empire. They vowed to ensure strength and stability under the guidance of a strong and centralized government watched over by an equally strong and authoritative Tsar.\n\nThe Soldarists, under the leadership of the firebrand Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn, offered an alternative direction, based on anti-communist thought. They pledged great victories and new glories for Russia and her people, under the guiding hand of the Tsar and his government.\n\nAs the end of the Congress drew near, the millions of votes cast across the Sovereignty were counted, and the delegates waited with baited breath."

The Solidarists offered the future, and the others offered only stagnation or collapse in turn.\n\nWhen the results were announced, and Solzhenitsyn was proclaimed Prime Minister-elect, Mikhail had to find a place to sit down, overcome with emotion.\n\nEverything he had hoped for Russia, from those early days in Vyatka through the news of Imperial conquest throughout the now-Sovereignty was now about to come true. Solzhenitsyn and the Solidarists, ably helped by men such as he would, regardless of what the failures in the other factions would say or try, bring glory and strength to Russia.\n\nAnd in so doing, claim the future for themselves."

With an almost agonizing slowness, the man prepared to speak.\n\n"By the will of the Russian people," the official said, "the All-Russian National Union shall form this first Imperial government." Concealing his light-headedness, and to the sound of applause from all present, Shulgin took the podium a moment later.\n\n"My fellow Russians," he began, taking care to enunciate each word clearly, "it will be my honor to form this first government, and become your Prime Minister. This is a day of great rejoicing for all of the Tsar's subjects, and for all of those who desire a strong and stable Russia.

Having now lived under two failed and brutal regimes, he was willing to give the so-called Tsar a chance. So far, as much as he could tell, the Romanov scion had done right by the people of Russia.\n\nHis attention was returned to the radio as the results of the Congress were announced. A victory, in a surprisingly clear majority, for the Constitutional-Democrats, or Kadets.\n\nMedvedev had not expected that. The Soviets had long taught that monarchism was inherently, and inexorably, reactionary. Instead, however, this new Empire seemed to be marching in the opposite direction, towards liberalism and democracy. He was not yet sure what to make of such a change, but he did know that he was looking forward to seeing what it truly meant.\n\nWith that thought, Medvedev finished his tea and went to bed.

As he did so, he saw that he had clearly interrupted a meeting, and seeing one of its attendee's begin to raise a rifle of their own, he held down his trigger.\n\nThe firefight was brutal and, thanks to the effects of automatic weapons in close quarters, extremely brief. When it was over, Andrei counted six dead partisans, among them a boy of no older than 15.\n\nHe swore to himself - killing boys, themselves likely forced into participation, was not part of the plan. But it was what had happened. Placing sentries outside the cottage, he and the others got to work searching for documents, messages, radio frequencies, or anything else that could lead them to other groups.\n\nWord had come down from the top to focus on looking for such, and Andrei was not a man to disobey orders."

Solzhenitsyn continued: "As of the end of today's legisaltive session I have been granted emergency powers for unilateral action within the Empire. The Duma has granted me these powers in order to allow the Empire to better end the instability that has ruled Russia for these past decades. Know that I take these powers with much reluctance and will relinquish them when the crisis has passed and Russia has been united under our rule."\n\nSurprise could be seen on the faces of those present. The Tsar himself only just kept his composure as the words left his Prime Minister's mouth. Solzhenitsyn spoke as though a great burden had been placed on his shoulders, but Vladimir could see the pleasure in his eyes. He gave off the impression of a cat that had just caught the canary, A sort of smugness that was at odds with the front he put up for the other men of the council.\n\nDespite the reassuring words that came out of the Prime Minister's mouth, Vladimir could only feel a cold weight settle into his gut. He remained silent throughout the meeting, unable to properly find his voice. When it was all over he retired to his study, to deal with the migraine that troubled him throughout the day."

As a hush fell over the buzzing crowd of attendees, opening statements, minutes and other obligatory introductions were made before cutting to the chase -- the three factions laying out their arguments.\n\nThe Kadets began first. Predictably, their rhetoric tended toward reform. They proposed rights for minorities, movements toward a progressive future and most importantly, the creation of a constitutional monarchy with a strong democratic system.\n\nThe VNS, in their own stuffy way, argued their points passionately. Recalling the nostalgia of the old empire, they made it clear they fought for conservative but democratic values. Little arguments for reform could be found among their statement, and they ultimately established themselves as a clear status quo candidate.\n\nNext came the speech from the NTS. Populism, nationalism, freedom and monarchism were their four key sticking points. They made a firm argument towards rejecting the ideas of both liberalism and communism, of holding the Russian man above any such system. They, however, were not without testaments toward democracy; how authentic that claim or its execution is or will be is unclear.\n\nReactions are mixed at current and only time will tell who will get their way."

He chuckled to himself as he sat on the street corner, troops marching in the streets. In his life, he had learned one thing, one simple truth: Politicians and Generals fought, but people like him would always be forgotten in the end. However, as he watched those young men smile, he felt conflicted. Perhaps...perhaps they would be different in the end.

Strife and warfare had been constants in his life which he rarely shied away from, yet as he walked down the aisle leading to His Imperial Majesty's suites, a slight feeling of nervousness rose in his chest as he prepared himself for his scheduled meeting. Gul took a deep breath before entering Vladimir's bureau.\n\nIt was like entering another world, one frozen in time: relics of another age presented all around he who dared to enter, Imperial furnitures striking Roman's gaze. And there was his liege, sat at his desk and seemingly having been awaiting the Prime Minister's arrival.\n\n"Your Imperial Majesty!" He said, in accordance with Imperial etiquette "I trust that you're doing well today?"\n\n"Prime Minister Gul" Vladimir retorqued in a formal tone "A slight migraine but nothing but nothing too serious. Please, take a seat, I'm sure you have much to tell me."\n\nGul executed himself. As thoughts raced in his mind, Roman started elaborating on his reform plans to the Tsar:\n\n"As I evoked in the past Your Imperial Majesty, we cannot go on with how poorly regarded personal freedoms are in Russia: the people, Russian and non-Russian speaking citizens, is - and should always be - our priority. Each and every one of your subjects deserve better lives, brighter futures, and though much has been done under your reign, absolute rule and austerity measures cannot be the norm forever. Now that Western Russia is stable, I come seeking your blessing and help in enacting a better tomorrow for our countrymen. Lest we fall to chaos and infighting again if their words cannot reach us."\n\nGul wasn't wrong: Western Russia was under complete control and those pesky austerity measures could be loosened, if not removed entirely. Yet, the weary middle-aged Tsar, minding to keep a composed facade, couldn't help but be somewhat worried of how far Roman's reforms will go at the expense of the Crown's power."

"I understand your hesitation- or any concerns, but Russia is plagued with instability; and these measures are an important step to securing everyone's future." Aleksander's words had a certain logic to them- but his tone had cooled, and Vladmir felt a single pang of uncertainty ringing at the back of his mind like a siren, a small little warning bell that kept ringing even as Aleksander spoke.

I am hesitant to take you out of such happy thoughts, but I have come here today for a reason, my Tsar. We must talk about your role in the new government. As we both know, the days of the absolute monarch have come to their end. However, it is imperative that you remain active in the governance of the Empire. You will be a key component of the Imperial government, and will have the final word in the Empire. You cannot simply be complacent on the sidelines." Shulgin, above all else, was a proponent of stability in the Empire. The Tsar was the greatest unifying symbol in the Empire and his wholehearted participation in the government was a key point to ensure stability.\n\nThe Tsar took a moment to gather his thoughts.

Beside him, his friend Konstantin was also putting up posters, albeit in a much more relaxed and less proficient fashion. Grigory elbowed him in the side.\n\n"Speed up!" he hissed. "If we don't get this street done within the hour they won't give us another box."\n\nKonstantin shrugged in reply. "I don't know why they're even bothering with this, you know," he said. "Nobody's even reading them. They're not going to stop calling it Sverdlovsk, so why is the mayor even doing this?"\n\nGrigory looked at him in disbelief. "You don't know? How-" he took a deep breath, and hammered another poster into the wall before continuing. "Sverdlovsk is where the Bolsheviks shot the old Tsar. They're planning a big memorial on the next anniversary, and the mayor is trying to curry favor by changing the name back from what they changed it to."\n\nKonstanin looked surprised. "Huh. I thought the old Tsar and his family were hanged in Moscow. At the end of a big trial."\n\nGrigory sighed again. "Well they weren't." He handed Konstantin half of their remaining posters.

That was before he realized that almost all of the new customers were Russian.\n\nAn Udmurt living among the Bashkirs in Ufa, Ven knew well what it meant to be a minority. He was also very practiced at identifying the ethnic composition of the places where he lived. And that practice was telling him that there were suddenly far more Russians in Ufa than there had been only a short while before.\n\nSure, he thought, Ufa had been growing even before reunification, but not enough to attract so much Russian settlement so quickly. So quickly that, if the trend continued, ethnic Russians would constitute a plurality just in time for the municipal elections.\n\nHe looked at the envelope on the counter - a letter from his sister in Izhvesk. He had not returned to Udmurt lands in years, for he had until now very much enjoyed living in Ufa. He did not look like the Bashkirs or pray to the same god, but he had been welcomed all the same. In Ufa, all those who had lived in the Russians' shadow for so long were welcome to share in the sunlight.\n\nBut now the Russians had returned, for better or worse, and how long would it be before he was once again seen as an outsider in a Russian city? No, he would rather live among people who welcomed him as one of their own, even if it meant leaving this life behind.\n\nThe time had come to pack his bags."

And I say to you, no longer!"\n\n"The Tsar, and therefore my government, will not rest until we reclaim what is rightfully ours. Until all of his subjects are liberated, and all of his lands, from Saint Petersburg to Vladivostok, are reunited and prosperous. This mutilation will be healed. Healed by you.

Yet, that idea was being challenged by Gul and his reforms that ever transformed the Russian monarchy into a constitutional one.\n\nThe Tsar and his Prime Minister were both sat on an Imperial styled couch that Vladimir had come into possession of, a memento of sort of a bygone era that he'd never come to know personally. He'd arranged a meeting with Gul on the matter of privileges accorded to the Tsar's family and himself, as fears of those being reduced, if not outright removed, started to plague Vladimir in the last few days.\n\n"Your Imperial Majesty, I understand that you fear seeing your royal privileges be taken away, especially as powers that once were yours until recent reforms are taken away to alleviate Your Majesty's shoulders. However, I can assure you that they shan't be taken away in any circumstance, as you remain the Tsar first and foremost, but also because you are a symbol to the people."\n\nVladimir listened with great attention, nodding to Gul's reassurances while a small weight was being lifted off his chest.
