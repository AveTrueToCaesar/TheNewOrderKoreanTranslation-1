USA.1705.t:0 "요키의 취임식"
USA.1705.d:0 "미국이 충격에 휩싸여 있고 워싱턴 D.C.에 전경들이 줄지어 배치되어 있는 채 미국 대통령으로 취임하기 위해 프란시스 파커 요키가 미국 국회의사당 건물의 계단을 오르고 있습니다. 불안한 비밀경호국 요원을 옆에 둔 신임 국민진보당 대표는 자신감에 찬 채 연단에 올랐습니다. 모든 역경에도 불구하고 그의 계획은 결실을 맺었으며 미국은 그의 말을 기다리고 있습니다.\n\n연단 주변 인물들은 취임식 때 기대했던 것 보다는 크게 눈에 띄진 않았는데, 공화민주당은 그의 대통령 취임식 참석을 거부하였으며 자기 소속 정당 중 상당수도 참석을 거부하고 있습니다. 독일국에서 온 소규모 대표단을 제외하면 해외 참석자들도 눈에 띄게 드물며 초청객 명단은 대부분 요키의 열렬한 지지자들로 구성되어 있습니다. 요키의 선거관리인인 로이스 드 라파예트 워시번은 카메라를 향해 미소지었으며 수수깨끼의 기부자인 해럴드 케이트 톰슨은 요기조기 보기 좋게 피해갔습니다. 새로 취임한 루이스 바이어스 부통령은 갈색 옷을 입은 지지자들에게 악수하며 사인을 해 주고 있으며, 하원의원 윌리스 카르토와 프레드 헌틀리는 대화를 나누고 있으며 존 크로멜린 제독은 무시무시한 시선으로 군중을 샅샅이 훑어보며 위험의 징후를 찾고 있습니다.\n군중은 세 무리로 나눌 수 있습니다. 첫째로 이 순간까지 닿기 위해 수십년 간 투쟁하며 이겨낸 약자의 후보자에게 동정심을 가지고 그의 비전으로 틀에 잡힐 미국을 보기 바라는 사람들이 있습니다. 둘째로 수정헌법 제1조의 권리를 행사하는 사람들은 다음 취임식이 오기 전까지 권리가 아에 박탈당할까봐 걱정하며 보는 사람들이 있습니다. 마지막으로, 두 집단을 갈라놓는 얉디얉은 의사당 경찰이 있습니다. 서로를 향해 항의하며 박수갈채와 함성이 튀어나오고 사람들은 소리를 들으러고 애씁니다.\n\n요키가 올라감에 따라 그의 연설문이 휘날리는 바람에 솟아오르며 불만을 표하는 소음만이 늘어날 뿐입니다. 최고 권력자는 요키의 지정학 및 문화이론에 대한 걸작인 임페리움을 화자에게까지 확대시킵니다.\n\n패배한 판사의 경멸적인 표정을 무시한 채 그는 한 손을 책 위에 올리며 맹세를 반복합니다.\n\n대통령은 손을 뒤로 젖히고 군중 쪽으로 돌아서서 말하기 시작합니다."

#Leader Description
POLITICS_YOCKEY_DESC:0 "프랜시스 파커 요키는 그가 대통령직에 오르리라고는 거의 누구도 예상치 못한 자였습니다. 그러나 미국 역사상 가장 치열했던 선거가 끝난 이후, 이 노골적인 파시스트는 대통령이 되었습니다. 본래 작가이자 철학자였던 요키는 1930년대 세계를 휩쓴 권위주의와 파시스트 운동에 매료되었습니다. 변호사가 되기 위해 공부하던 그는 아돌프 히틀러의 활동에 특별한 관심을 보였고, 나치의 반유대주의와 국수주의 사상을 받아들였습니다. 그가 스스로 명작이라 칭하는 "임페리움 : 역사와 정치의 철학"의 출간에 뒤이어, 요키는 국가진보당의 초극단적 우파를 창설함으로써 미국 정치에 새로운 움직임을 불어넣었습니다. 국가진보당의 이들 세력은 처음에는 "전미국가수호단"으로 자신들을 지칭했으나, 정계의 다른 모든 세력은 곧 이들을 혐오하게 되었고 요키와 그 추종자들을 단순히 "요키파"로 불렀습니다. 그러나, 이들의 정적들의 실패와 신의 섭리로 인해 그의 세력은 이제 미국의 정치 체계에 맞서 승리했습니다.\n\n요키의 대통령 당선은 쥐새끼 몇마리들 수준을 넘는 반향을 불러일으켰습니다. 미국의 수많은 도시들, 특히나 남부 주들에서 쿠 클럭스 클랜의 두건다린 흰 망토를 입은 자들을 보는 것은 이상한 일이 아닙니다. 비슷하게 지난 20여년 간 기념비적인 민권법안의 폐지에 대한 공공연한 논쟁이 벌어져 왔습니다. 흑인들에 대한 린치가 보편화되었고 이는 조사받지도, 발각되지도 않고 있습니다. 짧게 말해서 혐오가 미국 전역에 공공연화되고 있으며, 정치적 기득권층 내외의 많은 사람들이 이 권위주의적 파동이 어디까지 갈 지를 두려워하고 있습니다.\n\n비록 요키가 지구상의 자유 국가중 가장 강력한 국가의 지도자이긴 하나 그의 자유에 대한 입장은 불명확하고 모순되어 왔습니다. 많은 사람들은 그가 미국의 자유를 지키기 위해 어떤 겉치레를 하든간에 그는 여전히 파시스트이며 대통령직의 권위를 강화시키기 위해서는 무엇이든 할 것이라고 믿고 있습니다. 요키 스스로는 "문화 파괴자들"을 비난하며 서구 문명을 수호한다고 주장하고 있습니다. 요키가 그것을 정확히 어디로부터 수호하겠다는 것인지는 모호하나, 프랜시스 파커 요키 대통령은 미국에 그의 의지를 집행할 준비가 되어 있습니다."

The brewing stormclouds above proved no use to uplift Louisiana from the terrific heat that struck down upon the South.\n\n"First vote, first vote, good lord, gonna be fun! I know we missed this past Presidential election, but hell, voting for a Congressman can't hurt, can it, Lily?" Thomas said.\n\nLily nodded, and smiled, as she felt happy, but the pangs of worry continued to dawn in her, as she saw more and more whispering couples heading towards the booth.\n\n"I mean, just think of it, we got Republicans, Democrats, all sorts on the NPP, I mean, I know that President Yockey's not the most popular between us, and I'm not meaning to force you to vote for anybod-" Gravois said, before being cut off by a rushing police car, blaring its siren.\n\n"I don't know, Thomas, are we sure today's going to be a good day for participating within this here election? I know it's important and all, but something just ain't right about all of this, I bet you can feel it too." She says, as the rumble of thunderous stormclouds rolled within the distance.

Lily whispered.\n\nThe two looked forward, and none of the cheery election seasons of the past prepared them for the sight. No barbecues, no pins and stickers, no cheers and laughs from the crowds, but only the roaring of helicopters and armed guards roaming about. Between each booth laid an officer in riot gear, bearing the symbols of the American National Vanguard., as the crowd was moved forward with police on each side. Loudspeakers, sirens, all blared out, as lines were monitored, people were monitored, for God's sakes, each vote was monitored. The young couple looked at one another, wanting to back away and run all the way back home, but the shining glimmer of an officer's badge, lined up next to a patch for the Vanguard, shone into their eyes, as he beckoned them forth."

Jackson's defeat in the primaries had shattered the party and caused a slump in turnout, and the center had suffered the most. Pat Schroeder of the Colorado 1st had barely won in the recount, with a split vote between her, the RD candidate, and her primary opponent who had refused to acknowledge his defeat. The right had given warm welcomes and firm handshakes, but the Vanguard congressmen had not- despite being far from firmly controlling the party, they seemed to be in no hurry to reach across the aisle.\n\n"In these halls of Washington where conspiracy and scheming against the West has become the order of the day, we have removed the corrupters from the levers of power, and now bring them out to the observation and scrutiny of all clear-minded American observers."\n\nThe President had been speaking for some time. A title ill-suited for an unimposing man with a pompous and arrogant manner of speech, but an unmistakable knack for telling people what they wanted to hear. He almost looked fearful as he spoke, despite his power, as if one slip of the tongue might bring his regime crashing down. They had no majority without the party. They needed every vote they could get.\n\n"And we hold this truth to be self evident, that after a long train of abuses and usurpations, an usurpation of our own has become necessary, and with your support, we have achieved it! Regardless of what the legalities imposed on us by traitors demand, we shall no longer dictate to our Southern brethren how they ought to enforce their laws!"\n\nAnd the furious sound of applause echoed through the halls, and hope was extinguished."

"Vice President Byers, I implore you allow yourself to be seated for the world's next-spun few minutes, and listen towards the successes of the American National Vanguard against the likes of the tumors of Democracy." The words floated around the mind of Vice President Byers, and while his superior's rhetoric typically left him with a sense of pride pinned by a dosage of dread, he used the opportunity to listen in, as President Yockey flipped open the radio signal.

Rather, this Judeo-Bolshevik machination, this rebellion-child sprung from the seeds of Democracy, Liberalism, and the Constitution itself, this instigates not Child-like tantrums within my soul, but a greater understanding as to the frustrations to be held in reshaping this world. The Vanguard is prepared to mantle the mission of establishing National Socialism in the likes of this damned Country, no matter if the socialist, Jew, or otherwise soulful-degenerate is unwilling.

USA_yky_72_the_safe_act_desc:0 "If the 18th century ideology of "equality" were actually believed in, there would be no such thing as propaganda, since every man would think quite independently and would resent any attempt whatever to form his mind. This ideology, however, is shown precisely by the example of America, the country in which it was adopted with religious fervor to have no correspondence to reality whatever.\n\nIn America, the country where mass-thinking, mass-ideals, and mass-living dominate the collective life, propaganda is the prime form of dissemination of information. There are no publications in America addressed solely to the intellect; a Culture-distorting regime rests on its invisibility, and independent thinking by strong individuals is ipso facto hostile to such a regime. Nor are there any publications which purvey only facts. Any facts, and any viewpoints, are coordinated with their presentation into the ruling propaganda-picture.\n\nIt is imperative that the danger of these publications be brought to the forefront of the Western culture-mind apparatus. We must commence the establishment of a new organ in the American super-political organism, one instructed in the methods of detecting and destroying propaganda by exposing its lies to the ignorant masses."
