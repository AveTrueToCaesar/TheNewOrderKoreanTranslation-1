 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_POKRYSHKIN_DESC:0 "제2차 세계대전의 전설적인 에이스 조종사이자 소련의 영웅인 알렉산더 이바노비치 포크리슈킨은 전쟁이 끝난 후 그의 고향인 노보시비르스크로 돌아갔습니다. 비교적 평화로운 삶을 살길 바랬던 그는 운명이 그를 어디로 이끄는지 알지 못했습니다.\n\n포크리슈킨은 중앙 시베리아 공화국의 통치에 만족했고, 결국 공화국 정부에 들어갔습니다. 공화국 하의 노보시비르스크 시를 관리하는 일은 시베리아 전쟁 전까지만 해도 비교적 간단한 일이었습니다. 하지만, 야고다가 이끄는 강력한 동쪽의 최고 소비에트를 상대하기 위해 그는 도시 전역을 전시체제로 탈바꿈시켜야 했습니다. 배급제가 도입되었고, 시의 수많은 젊은이들이 징병되어 시베리아 전장의 총알받이로 보내졌습니다. 어느 순간, 그는 한계에 도달했고, 바르나울 시장 바실리 슈크신과 접촉한 후 그는 계획을 실행에 옮겼습니다.\n\n 두 사람과 부하들은 노보시비르스크를 신속히 점령하여, 어느 외부 영향도 받지 않고, 러시아의 혼란상 속에서 홀로 서있는 진정으로 독립적인 정부를 설립했습니다. 이제 그는 바르나울과의 불안한 동맹을 통해 시를 통치하고 있고, 그의 도시를 안정화시킬 필요가 있어 보입니다. 많은 인구를 보유한 노보시비르스크는 산업과 기능적 농업의 중심지이지만, 여전히 내적, 외적 측면에서 직면해야 할 문제들이 있으며, 이를 해결하는 것은 포크리슈킨에게 달려 있습니다."

 POLITICS_VASILY_SHUKSHIN_DESC:0 "1929년 알타이 크라이에서 태어난 바실리 마카로비치 슈크신은 촉망받는 작가였고, 정치에 발을 담그고 바르나울 시장에 당선됩니다. 그는 오랫동안 끝없는 길을 걸어왔습니다 : 연방이 중앙 시베리아 공화국에서 막 분리독립했을 때 포크리슈킨의 옛 동맹이었던 바실리는, 그의 연방주의, 민주주의 이상과 동떨어진 부패를 일삼았던 그의 옛 동맹과 사업 동료들과 충돌했습니다. 하지만 그 또한 머릿속으론 이상주의를 내세웠지만 연방 대통령이 되기 위해 막후거래와 협상을 일삼았죠.\n\n이제 실로비키로부터 국가 통치권을 빼앗은 바실리는 더이상 뒤에서 편안히 앉아있지 않기로 결정했습니다. 실로비키는 힘을 잃었지만, 기업들의 부패는 공화국에 막대한 해를 끼치고 있기 때문입니다.\n\n민주주의의 사막이었던 러시아에 꽃이 피게 하려면 그는 그의 대통령 재임기간 동안 기업들이 야기한 문제들을 해결해 나가야 할 것입니다."

 ### Ideas ###
 PAV_Disproportionate_Population:0 "인구 불균형"
 PAV_Disproportionate_Population_desc:0 "노보시비르스크는 극동 지역의 중심지로서 시베리아 횡단철도의 중요한 통행지여서 우랄 산맥 전역에 걸쳐 항상 가장 발달하고 인구밀도가 높은 지역 중 하나입니다. 이 도시는 대조국전쟁이 발발했을 때에도 시베리아에서 가장 큰 도시 중 하나였고 전쟁으로 인해 도시가 더욱 커지게 되었습니다.\n\n수천 명의 사람들이 독일의 점령지 혹은 러시아에서의 혼란에서 벗어나 민간인들로 북적이는 노보시비르스크에 도착하였습니다. 이것은 축복이자 저주이지만, 우리가 안고 함께 살아가야만 하는 것입니다."
 PAV_The_All_Siberian_Army:0 "전 시베리아 군대"
 PAV_The_All_Siberian_Army_desc:0 "노보시비르스크의 보호를 책임지는 군대는 중앙시베리아의 가장 강력하고 명망있는 군대 중 하나입니다. 시베리아의 매가 톰스크 정부로부터 갈라져 자신과 백성들을 전쟁의 참상에서 구했을때, 중앙시베리아 공화국 군대의 상당수가 포크리슈킨에게 충성을 맹세했고, 남쪽에서 재편성 되었습니다.\n\n전 시베리아 군대는 노보시비르스크의 거대한 이웃 국가들과 견줄 수 있는 군대로 개혁되었으며, 많은 사람들이 대조국 전쟁과 시베리아 전쟁에서 얻은 숙련도는 귀중한 것으로 널리 퍼졌습니다."

 PAV_Untouched_Industry_desc:0 "러시아의 많은 군벌들과는 달리, 노보시비르스크는 운 좋게도 거대하고 온전한 산업기반을 가지고 있습니다. 노보시비르스크가 독일 폭격기들이 폭격을 가하는 구역 밖에 있는 것과 더불어 독일 침공 당시 구 소련의 생산력을 우랄에서 신속하게 철수시킨 것이 이 같은 사실의 주요 원인입니다.\n\n바르나울의 농업 생산력까지 고려한다면, 왜 우리가 가장 발전된 군벌 국가 중 하나로 여겨지고 어떠한 적보다 우위를 점할 수 있는 이유가 분명합니다."
 PAV_The_Great_Opioid_Epidemic:0 "아편양제제 유행병"
 PAV_The_Great_Opioid_Epidemic_desc:0 "마약은 러시아의 군벌에서는 찾아보기 어렵지만, 노보시비르스크는 많은 사람들에게 불법 물질 거래에 참여할 수 있는 기회를 제공했습니다. 인구가 많고 경제가 선진화되면서 중앙정부는 그러한 제품이 유통되는 암시장을 퇴치하는 문제들에 직면해 있습니다.\n\n문제가 걷잡을 수 없이 계속 커지면서 지역사회에 더 큰 영향을 미치기 시작하였으며, 노보시비르스크에 마약중독이 점차 커지고 있습니다."

Even the Tsars and the Soviets never fully extended their administrations over this region, and the eastern warlords never came close to matching what they did accomplish. The task of integrating this territory has been left to us.\n\nThe urban centers of the east will form a nucleus of a new administrative web that will cover all of eastern Siberia. Every town and village, every isolated hamlet, all of them will be assigned to districts and administrative regions, and each will have administrators and politicians appointed to oversee them and represent them within our government. No more will the Far East be an isolated backwater forgotten by the Russian government. It is an integral part of the Russian nation, and it will be treated as such."

The east must be brought up to standard.\n\nWe shall develop the Far East the same way the Soviets developed inland Siberia.

The vote was closer than we liked, and there is work to be done before the next round of elections eventually come around.\n\nDistricts and voting precincts must be redrawn to better represent the loyal citizens of the Federation and avoid empowering radical elements.

Vast expanses, laden with resources, people, and strategic positions. Expanses that would, in time, fall under the Federation's control.\n\nIt was only natural, he continued, that the Federation, with Novosibirsk at its heart, possessed a special destiny not seen elsewhere in Siberia. It was the largest city east of the Urals, formed a critical junction on the primary route of travel across Siberia, and lay in a major region of development of Bukharin's Siberian plan.\n\nWas it not, he concluded, therefore logical that the Federation would leverage those advantages to reclaim lands rightfully belonging to it? Further, having accomplished that goal, was it not similarly logical that the Federation would continue expansion, over all of Siberia?\n\nOf course it was, Pokryshkin thundered. It was not only logical, it was inevitable. It was right. The Federation had a destiny, a right, to unite Siberia. It would do so. And on that great day, would it stop? No, he said decisively.

It was clear they meant business, and in Novosibirsk, there was little more valuable than meaning business.\n\nA few people whispered, here and there; a friend of a friend had said this or that about the government wanting to eradicate terrorism, and that the police presence was to keep an eye on the ordinary people that the Narodniks blended into so easily. Soon, the whole street knew the news, then the streets nearby, and by the end of the day everyone in the city knew they might be unknowingly watched at any moment. For once, all the complaints of the citizenry was silenced, all their usual bravery frozen in place.

Although the Federation, and Shukshin's own values, lay based upon freedom, he could not help but feel perhaps it was leniency that had allowed these industrialists to lay claim to his home. In several meetings, Shukshin had brought up his misgivings with the direction of the town's development only to find many of his trusted aides in the pocket of the very same hounds preying upon Barnaul's newfound prosperity. Thus, he went out to the River once again to think. Shukshin felt conflicted with the idea of pushing the pocketed officials out, as each had gotten there through their own merit. Part of him felt it was vanity, the idea of holding something as trivial as the beauty of the nostalgic river over his own values. In the fields just beyond the river, however, he saw men breaking their backs for a day's wage dropped like crumbs by richer men.

Langemak had chosen today in hopes of slighting the Mayor, but alas.\n\nHowever, the contract the government shall sign with the Sibir Corporation would bring them closer together. Langemak smirked. Pokryshkin knew how these corporations worked. The bottom line was far more crucial to the livelihood of these companies than infrequent visits from an eccentric actor-politician. He took a seat and waited, checking his watch in-between reading magazines sponsored by the Sibir. Most of them were agriculture-related, and most of them depicted golden fields of wheat, their grains undulating under the gentle wind. He waited for close to an hour before the receptionist returned, wearing a sheepish smile on her face. "I am sorry for the delay, sir." She said. "Our guest just left.

He had been pleasantly surprised to see a new, privately owned, broadsheet at the stall, he had grown used to the state-press and its patriotic drivel. Now though, he could properly enjoy an unbiased paper run by right-thinking Russians telling it like it is.\n\nSitting at the fireplace with a cup of tea and a newspaper felt quite nostalgic for him. On the front page was a picture of striking workers surrounded by corporate security forces. The headline read, "Sibir Worker's Strike! Blood on the Streets." Intrigued, he read through the report. Apparently, workers at a Sibir plant went on strike for higher wages and ended up rioting and killing several Sibir guards. A unit of the army had to be called in to quell the strike and it ended with several dead and wounded.\n\nMikhail couldn't help but be shocked. For the life of him, he could not understand what would compel those workers to strike, let alone so violently. Life was better than it had ever been in Novosibirsk. He had plenty of food on the table every month, his business was doing very well, his wife and her friends had all the time in the world to gossip to their heart's content.

The factory he worked at had been bought out by the Sibir corporation and the new regulations they had imposed had left him practically penniless. He could only just afford his room at the flophouse and went without food on most nights.\n\nHe knocked at the door in the appropriate pattern and waited. The door opened and he was dragged inside. In the dim light of a candle he could see a group of five men and women gathered around what looked like the floor plan of a factory. The woman who dragged him through the door looked him up and down before gesturing him toward the table. "Welcome, comrade. Tell me, why are you here?" she demanded.\n\n"To fight for the people of Novosibirsk and to end the tyranny of the Silovik regime," he responded. He had read the pamphlets and attended a couple of secret meetings before this, though none as important as this one. The woman looked satisfied by his response, if not particularly enthused.\n\nThe woman looked back over the floor plan before she spoke again, "Welcome, Comrade Siniy. We must prepare for your first assignment. The pigs at the Sibir Corporation have opened a new manufacturing plant for the production of top of the line small arms. It will be our job to relieve the plant of its new manufacturing specs, and to cause as much damage to the plant as we can."\n\nAleksandr, or Comrade Siniy as he was now known, felt his throat tighten as a submachine gun was pressed into his hands.

He turned around once, to see Pokryshkin with his characteristic uniform being escorted by a squad of agents to safety, somewhere near his residence, but he could not lose track of the assassin as he headed into the narrow roads of the city. With all the energy he had left in him after this exhausting day of preparations, he ran as fast as he could, jumping over objects and pushing over civilians, but always keeping his eyes on the target. However, as he saw him reach the Oktyabrsky Bridge and jump over the railing, he shouted in vain one last time, as the killer fell into the freezing waters of the Ob River.\n\nTwo days later, Pokryshkin was in a highly classified meeting in the Presidential Residence, together with Security Minister Glinka. The proof had been laid in front of him, and it was as clear as day: the Narodniks were behind the recent attempt on his life. The trail of evidence had been followed by his trustworthy subordinates, and now it was time for justice to be served.\n\n"Sir, things are different now." Glinka's hesitation in his voice was obvious, but he continued nevertheless. "We thought the Narodniks were a simple nuisance to the Federation, a small group that could be rooted out. This assassination attempt proves the exact opposite - they are a credible threat with influence in the underworld, and one which will have to be dealt with.

"The Narodniks, unconvinced by our noble state and institutions, continue to wage a campaign of terror and have, in fact, ramped up their efforts as has recently been made clear.

In the dark alleys of the biggest cities, as well as in the mountainous countryside fit for resistance cells, many were caught, occasionally even after being ratted from civilians.

Konstantin didn't know how successful the former would be, but he knew very well that, at least in his case, the latter very much would be. He would make sure of it.\n\nThere was a lot of very hard work to do. The house had to be essentially rebuilt. The fields needed to be cleared and planted. Harvests needed to be planned. Konstantin had never been a farmer, but the future promised for his family could not be ignored.\n\nThey had a home again. Land to call their own.

Corporate security guards made a loose and patchy ring around the striking workers, waiting for orders from their superiors on just what to do.\n\nVasily Minkovsky stood in front of the crowd and gave a fiery speech about the injustices of the corporations. He harkened back to the times under Bukharin, where the workers were given generous rights and conditions in the factories were as safe as they could be made. Behind him was hung a tattered flag of the Soviet Union. The workers of Novosibirsk had decided they would not stand for their continued abuse.\n\nAs he came to a lull in his oratory there was a change in the air. The corporate goons had retreated to the offices across the street, and it soon became obvious why. Two corporate IFVs rolled down the street towards the crowd, a man with a megaphone calling for the strikers to return to work. When his demands were unanswered the IFVs unleashed canisters of teargas into the crowd. Cries went up as those nearest the gas panicked and fled, eyes and lungs burning. Corporate goons advanced on the crowd, beating those they caught with batons.\n\nThen a shot rang out.\n\nPanicking workers trampled each other to get out of the line of fire while Corporate security fired wantonly into the crowd. Vasily tried to regain some semblance of calm, but it was in vain as he was hit in the gut by a burst of fire from a panicking guard. He fell, reaching for the flag of the Union.

Immediately after sitting down, a man wearing an old army uniform entered into the room, differing in age compared to the mostly young students who made up the Narodnik cell. "Good evening, comrades," said the older man. "I am pleased to welcome our newest recruit, Anton Levitsky, to the revolution. As you know, our fight against the tyrannical Alexander Pokryshkin is only just beginning. The Narodniks as a whole have seen much success, yet our cell has done little to assist the rest of our comradery. If the revolution is to succeed, we must aim for larger targets."\n\n"Like what?" Said Anton, turning on his audio recorder. "The army has stepped up their game, and we have become a massive priority for the Novosibirsk government."\n\n"I'm sure you know of the many rail lines that cross the Ob river," said the commander. "Taking down an entire bridge will have Novosibirsk cut in half for months!.\n\nAnton grimaced while the other Narodniks cheered."If I may ask, commander, but where are we going to get enough explosives to destroy the bridge, and who's going to do it? Looking around, we don't seem very qualified," Anton said.\n\n"The commander smiled.

The Narodniks would soon be sorely disappointed. "Well Anton, looks like everything is ready." Said Pavel, his cell commander, still wearing that old uniform.\n\nTaking out a lighter, Anton took a breath and lit the fuse. "We should probably run farther back, there's a clearing a ways away that should lead to a good escape." And the group of officers waiting to arrest them, Anton thought to himself. He couldn't risk these terrorists getting another chance, even though it was so soon since he joined.\n\n"Are you kidding, and missing this beautiful explosion? We can head to that ridge instead." Replied Pavel, and the others agreed.\n\n"Wait-" but it was too late, the others were already following their commander. Anton cursed under his breath and ran after them.\n\nReaching the ridge, Pavel frowned. "Anton, why hasn't the bridge exploded yet? Did the fuse break?"\n\nAnother Narodnik pointed to the bridge. "Commander, the SB! We've got to get out of here!" Looking at the bridge, it appeared the officers had realized the Narodniks were not falling for Anton's trap, instead heading over to cut the fuse.\n\n"Shit! We've got to go before they see us."

The worker in question, named Ivan Yahontov, was seriously injured in the blast, but was located and detained by civilian authorities. Yahontov had been associating with suspected Narodniks for several weeks prior to the bombing, and appears to have collaborated with two other individuals: Sergei Preobrazhensky (died in the explosion), and Alexei Turgenev (Reported sick day of the incident, was not found at his residence when investigated). The manager of the manufacturing plant was not harmed, and is quite incensed by what he sees as the government's failure to contain the Narodnik threat.\n\nCurrent estimates place damages at a cost equivalent to 2,000,000USD. There are 17 reported deaths and over 30 wounded, of which 17 are in critical condition. Currently, 5 employees of the plant are not accounted for, with the site too damaged and obstructed to allow further searches until a later point in time.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Narodnik threat was greater than previous predictions.

Alongside information extracted from I. Yahontov, a series of raids were conducted. Over 17 arrests have been made against the Narodniks and their allies. Among these arrests are also severely agitated workers distributed weapons by the Narodniks. While not all of the currently arrested terrorists have been interrogated, it was clear that the Narodniks were targeting working class demographics with propaganda, and had already succeeded in converting workers to their cause. Currently, known Narodnik-sympathizers are still being brought in and investigated.

Kostin angrily hacked away at the stone with his pick, wishing desperately that the reverse had been true. Capitalist oppression continued, and the dawn seemed very far away indeed. As he used his soot-blackened hands to load chunks of stone into the nearby cart, another thought occurred.\n\nWas the dawn so far away? Indeed, the Narodniks had failed in their mission, but so too had the state expended a great deal of time and resources putting them down. The Siloviks were raw, vulnerable.

Any tension from the meeting evaporated as the bodyguard stepped aside and the two powerful men shook hands and exchanged formalities. Seva soon found himself holding a crate of documents. Chernyshevsky's bodyguard held a manilla folder. What was in it? Pokryshkin often gave money or financial insider news in such courtesy calls. Chernyshevsky was an up and coming silovik, a man with a growing network of his own.

Seva took note of the riflemen on the roof relaxing their stance. It paid to be prepared for anything, when one worked in the business of presidential security. The bodyguard sat in the back of Pokryshkin's car, finally allowing himself a moment of rest. His boss looked in a particularly jovial mood. Leafing through the intelligence report, the president smiled contentedly. "It seems that old man Pasternak is on the move again."\n\n"War, boss?" Seva asked. Pokryshkin shook his head.

It was, predictably, reinforced steel, and the demolitions team had already begun to set up a charge. Luka took the opportunity to catch his breath. Around him, the other SB men did the same, sucking in the stale, dusty air of the bunker. After a moment, the rest was over, and the charges detonated.

 PAV_expansion.5.desc:0 "Alexey Pesterev didn't often feel fear, but when he came face to face with Pokryshkin, the man who led the newly formed Federation, he felt his internal temperature drop a couple degrees. It wasn't the physique or mannerism of the man that disturbed him, but it was the simple reality of the situation. Coming face to face with the man who overthrew his government, and on the other side of a jail cell, conjured up images that Pesterev would rather not have.\n\nAnd so they sat there, waiting for the other to make a move, up until Pokryshkin spoke up.\n\n"Mr. Pesterev," said Pokryshkin, "I understand that you and Andreev are on less than stellar terms."\n\n"Considering that I'm in a jail cell, yes, me and him are not exactly the best of friends at the moment."\n\nPokryshkin laughed. "That is understandable. You know, I hate to see such potential wasted, rotting in a cell. I've always preferred to think of human life as having a little bit more value alive than dead, or in prison."\n\nPesterev felt his eyebrows raise a little, wondering where this was going.\n\n"I have a proposition for you, if you would like to hear it."\n\n"A proposition...?"\n\nPokryshkin pulled out a piece of paper, and slid it in between the metal bars. "I am not an expert in the affairs of Krasnoyarsk, or its people. Nor do I think I could learn it in the time necessary to make a difference. That is why I am offering you an opportunity to work for me, for your freedom, and for a better future for Russia. You don't have to decide now, b-"\n\n"I'll do it."\n\nPokryshkin stopped, a little shocked at being interrupted. That look, however, disappeared, and was replaced with a smile. "I didn't expect that, especially after how long you worked for Andreev."\n\nPesterev smiled in spite of his best attempts at suppressing it. "Well, it's not like I haven't done it before."

Almost all are holdout generals, militias and other organizations that refused to submit to the will of the Federation, and instead placed their rebellion at the barrel of a gun.\n\nWhat began as outright treasonous acts, openly committed by militiamen, gradually transformed into terrorism against the state and its property. Army compounds were bombed, killing dozens and injuring more. Police headquarters, set up in high population areas, were routinely attacked and looted for firearms, and, as quickly as they were attacked, the HQs were empty of all Red perpetrators.\n\nBut the former Free Territory could only hold out for so long. Soon, as weeks turned to months, some of the diehards began to question whether their acts were in any way helpful to their cause. Soon, as the troops began pouring in, and the compounds and safe houses were raided, the members of the underground Black Army began to dissipate. Some chose to leave the Free Territory, others the whole of Central Siberia. A couple even decided to leave Russia, hoping for a better chance at the revolution abroad.\n\nSome, however, decided to stay, and while they continue their revolutionary activities, the All-Siberian Army has been ever present to combat them. While the remnants may never fully go away, the Siberian Army stands tall and ready to crack whatever resistance remains."

To many others, the outcome was expected, and the shock came from how long it took.\n\nDespite the Federation's best efforts, the imprints of Anarchism could not be fully removed. It had been too embedded into society for that to happen, especially among the working class, who, unsurprisingly, made up most of the Workers Councils. Kansk was the biggest of them, and threatened outright rebellion against the Federation if such an action was ever taken.\n\nThat, of course, was only rhetoric. Everyone knew that, one way or another, the Workers Councils would be destroyed. Many even within the Councils debated what course of action to take, but, despite the radicalism of some members, the majority accepted defeat. The Proclamation was expected, and they tried, with the best of their abilities, to make the transition as best as possible.\n\nBut the next day, it was reported in the papers of Kansk that three different Megacorporations had begun to carve up the formerly worker run factories, shops, and other facilities controlled by the Councils. Within the course of several weeks, the unions, once so powerful, started to accept their old places in the hierarchy of capitalism. Neighborhoods once more became divided between workers, with the corporations battling out in the remains of who would get what."

Before the Winter War and Barbarossa, before the fall of Moscow and the long march across the Urals.\n\nWhat a fucking joke!\n\nThe Army had been betrayed, self-sabotaged at every turn by politicians and secret police who had no idea what they were doing. Officers arrested for disobeying suicidal orders, NKVD flunkies second-guessing every move, men wasted in futile counter-attacks and reckless offensives. All headed by a man who seemed more interested in moving cities in Siberia then leading a nation at war.\n\nNow here he was, a remnant of another remnant of the Red Army. Rumors were going around that the Federation's armed forces were offering to take in anyone willing.

Administering these new conquests have already become the subject of furious debate within the government, however.\n\nPresident Pokryshkin, unsurprisingly, advocates for a simple process of annexation into the Federation as a regular territory. This would further encourage the centralization of our authority, but some argue that the federally-administered territories are stretched thin enough as it is, and adding new lands on top of that would only compound our problems.\n\nThe influential mayor of Barnaul, Vasily Shukshin, has put forward a different proposal altogether. He believes it would be necessary to form a new republic within the Federation's borders: the Federal Republic of Tuva. Not only would this make integration a more painless affair, but would also go great lengths towards discouraging separatism.\n\nThe final say, of course, lies with the president..."

Sometimes, however, even his passions would prove frustrating, as Shukshin had spent the past hour and a half debating how to actually start this particular piece.\n\nLaying his pen aside, Shukshin sighed as he reached for his drink. Before his hands could even touch the glass, the phone rang and shattered the melancholy silence of his office. So much for that drink, he thought. "Shukshin here. I hope you've got good news for me."\n\n"It's Kerchenko. Your proposal about the Tuvan Republic? It went through."\n\nShukshin's eyes went wide. This was not the outcome he was expecting. "Really? I'm surprised Pokryshkin let it happen. This is good news!"\n\n"Indeed. You should probably come down here and make an announcement before he takes all the credit."\n\n"Very well, I'll see you soon, Kerchenko." Shukshin signed off as he placed the phone back.

The President had been seemingly looking to consolidate state power for a long time now, and the Tuvan issue was only another small step towards that lofty goal.\n\nWhile the Federalists were mildly annoyed but not entirely unprepared, none were more disappointed than the Tuvan people themselves. The peoples of the Altay had come to appreciate what little autonomy they had been granted under the Soviet Union, and hoped that the democratic Novosibirsk government would continue this old policy.\n\nInstead, this minority group finds itself on the rocky road to full integration within the resurgent Russian behemoth. Sporadic protests and dissent have been reported throughout the People's Revolutionary Council's former territories, but so far it is nothing that local security forces cannot handle."

Cradling his rifle, he waited with nervous energy.\n\nAs the lieutenant blew his whistle, the young private launched himself forward with the rest of his platoon as machine guns sprayed death a foot off the ground in controlled bursts.\n\nTwenty minutes later, part of the platoon sat on the far side of the enemy position, much of it, Ivanov included, deemed casualties. Turning his attention away from the exercise and back towards his fellow squadmates, the private turned back into the conversation.\n\n"-all these exercises?

Yet, as he watched soldiers march through Novosibirsk's streets, all he could feel was apprehension.\n\nPokryshkin meant well, that much was obvious, but he could see the divide between the two of them was growing with every passing day.

 PAV_expansion.14.desc:0 "Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and today you're listening to Radio Free Siberia, the best news for the people of Siberia. I'm your host, Koryavov Nikitovich, but you can call me Nicholas for short. They say it's because I look like Tsar Nicholas, but it's not true, I swear!\n\nToday, I am here to discuss certain criticisms of the current rule of our country. Now now, I believe in free speech, but I believe that certain intellectuals are slandering our government, and by God I am going to come to its defense!\n\nThe first biggest slanderous lie is that our government is cynical. That is just a boldfaced lie. Our government is not cynical, it is pragmatic. You see, these famous philosophers, they make these funny little words up like 'cynical' and 'corporatization' in order to slander the Federation, but, let's be real here, when has a philosopher ever done something for you? Say what you want about the Federation, but it has brought numerous people out of poverty, brought economic development, and brought order. Sure, maybe they've been a little too heavy handed, but, hey, I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of my freedom for the sake of a better future.\n\nThe second, and the one I find the most offensive, is that our Federation is destined for failure, that we're too weak to get anything done. That is not only wrong, it is offensive, to the leaders and generals of this country, who have sacrificed countless man hours just to keep you and I safe from the hoards that lay behind our borders. We have a strong economy, strong leaders, and strong soldiers, who are going to be made even stronger by the first two.\n\nAnd the Federation will be made even stronger as the years go by, as economic development increases continually. According to some analysts, we may even become stronger than Germany when taking into account reunification and economic development.\n\nNow, to my fellow patriots, I leave you with a good little song that some of you may remember. It's a little different from how you remember it, but, hey, it may be better for you that way!"

 PAV_expansion.15.desc:0 "Pokryshkin sat at his desk, looking out onto the streets. It was bright, but not bright enough to block out the shining of the stars overhead. Looking towards them made him remember his childhood, and the horrible poverty he had experienced. Of course, that seemed so much more quaint than the poverty of some after the collapse, but it was still painful.\n\nHe had crawled to the top of the air force, crawled from that slum and from those criminals and hoodlums to become one of the most famous airmen in Russia. And yet, it did nothing. The Germans came marching still, like the Huns of the West, crushing and butchering everything in their paths. He could still remember flying above a town, burnt to the ground, smoke filling the sky. All he could imagine then were the screams, and the flaying bodies.\n\nAnd now, he was the leader of a nation, a nation whose principles seemed so in line with his own. Liberation, freedom, decentralization. Far from the centralized nightmare that was the Soviet Union. And yet, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get it to work. The pieces wouldn't fit. He couldn't fit the square peg into the round hole.\n\nAnd so he compromised. A stronger office here, a stronger government there, until he realized that the ball of centralization kept going further and further. And now those principles, those principles he sacrificed so much for, had been ripped up.\n\nAnd, the worst part about it, was that he felt nothing. Pokryshkin felt like he should feel something, some sadness at the death of utopianism he had. But he didn't. The compromises, in his eyes, worked. Without them, he wouldn't be where he was. Without them, his people wouldn't be anywhere near as good as they are now.\n\nPerhaps, Pokryshkin thought, the principles of the Federation would be revived. Perhaps the government would give their constituent parts more say in their affairs, more trust in the people. But he doubted that. And so, he looked out the window, just as he did as a young man."

Barnaul was not nearly as important as the great city itself, of course, but it was important enough, and he was important enough within it, to be able to take some form of action.\n\nAnd that action had worked. He had been able, if only for a short while, to delay several measures focused on further increasing that degree of centralization. He knew he should have felt joy, or at least satisfaction, at such success. And yet, he did not, for he knew that though he had slowed the process, he had not, and would not be able to, halt it for very long.\n\nHis influence and popularity would allow him to do so for a while longer, but as he regarded the reports, all he could think about was how much time he had won.\n\nAnd how he knew it would not be much."

He had tired, of course, and it wasn't like he enjoyed working until the AM, but it was something that the man felt as if he had to do.\n\nShukshin's place in the administration of the Federation had placed him front and center in what passed for political machinations of the polity, resulting in his less-than-cynical ideas being the natural foil for his political counterpart, Pokryshkin. But as the documents bled together, the words and letters became increasingly incomprehensible in Shukshin's brain, out of the fog that permeated his mind came the deep worries that only ever emerged on the latest of nights.\n\nHis mind went to the origins of the federation, and how it was originally based on freedom and liberty, but how the necessity of the federation's system had resulted in an erosion of the federation's basic principles, revealing corruption, apathy, and cynicism - unfortunately embodied by many of his political peers. He felt conflicted about his role in the state, and how it would, or wouldn't play out. He had once been a genuine democrat, convinced of the federation's noble methods. But as the situation degraded, Shukshin could do nothing but wonder if his support of Pokryshkin and the federation in general had been worth it. After no small deliberation, Shukshin spoke to himself, quietly, as if he wanted no one to hear despite the utter absence of company in his lonely office.\n\n"I remember the struggle against tyranny.

He had always been of little relevance. His message had always been able to be contained.

Pokryshkin's state was growing rapidly - in economic power, physical size, and military capability - and could, in short order, pose a threat to the interests of the Sphere.\n\nThat is, if it were allowed to forge close relationships with other states without also doing so with Japan itself. In addition, a number of Japanese industrial concerns had voiced the potential benefits of future business relationships with the growing state, and such could not be ignored.

Operating conditions within his factory, in terms of both safety and workload, had improved, and he found himself, at the end of the day, still possessing considerable energy. With the chance to relax. This was most unusual.\n\nIt also led to Grigory asking many questions. Why was this the case? Was the Federation's government truly committed to the reform that he had heard promised, and originally dismissed as yet another empty pledge? Were they temporary measures, intended only to placate the thousands upon thousands of workers who had risen in the Great Revolt? And, if so, how long would they last?\n\nFor a long while Grigory debated these questions within himself, until he realized, at long last, that the answer did not matter. Or that, if it did, it certainly didn't matter to him. No matter what it truly was, his workday had, quite simply, gotten both easier and safer.\n\nAnd that was good enough for him."

Just because the Republic fell doesn't mean we can't still look to the future, eh?"\n\nMikhail seemed to consider it silently, finding some solace from the anxiety the whole team felt since Federation troops marched through Tomsk. Luka wished he believed his own words, but he couldn't. After the surrender, he found himself alone with Mikhail, Artyom, and three other scientists looking to him for guidance. He was prepared to work within a command structure and lead a small team on a single project, not make decisions for people that would shape the rest of their lives without any guidance. It wasn't what he wanted, it wasn't fair, and yet, here he was.\n\nThe worst part was the simplicity of the choice offered to them. They would work for Titan, or they would not work at all. The sheer injustice of it drove Luka to tears sometimes, but there was simply nothing else. Titan bought out everything. There was no other way. Something died in him every time he told himself that, but perhaps it was for the best. It made it easier to look at his team members in the eye when he spoke to them.\n\nLuka looked to the rest of his team while Mikhail stared out the window in contemplation. They sat quietly, the usual lively discourse dead and gone. No more theories, no more arguments, no more idealism. Instead, their eyes revealed the same image as in Luka's heart: a lonely flame in the dark, finally sputtering out.\n\n"But... Without the Republic, what are we even working for anymore?" Mikhail asked, desperation once again in his voice.\n\n"The same thing we've always been working towards," Luka said, his lip twisting into a lifeless smile as he repeated the motto of his soon-to-be employer:"

 PAV_superregional.1.t:0 "A Den of Radicals"
 PAV_superregional.1.desc:0 "Pokryshkin tossed the report onto his desk in disgust. It was a general overview on the situation in far eastern Siberia, and reading through it had dashed all traces of optimism he had felt about the region. It wasn't all bad, to be fair. Controlling the port town of Magadan finally gave them access to the sea, and with a little investment Irkutsk could become a major economic and industrial hub. But aside from a few scattered bright spots like those the report was nothing but bad news. The far east had always been difficult to administer, even for a united Russian nation. Now he had to attempt the same task with far less resources than the Empire or the Union had been able to field. And on top of everything else, there was the main topic of the report: Partisans.\n\nBased on early reports alone Pokryshkin's security experts were telling him there were no less than eight organized radical terrorist organizations operating in the far east, and possibly as many as a dozen. They came in all stripes. Fascists, communists, monarchists, anarchists, zealots, Cossacks, separatists, and more besides. The only reason they hadn't already collapsed the entire east into partisan warfare was because they spent as much time fighting each other as the central government. The report warned that might not be the case forever. The longer they are allowed to exist, the more likely it is that like-minded groups will form a common front against the newly formed Russian Federation. This cannot be allowed to happen.\n\nPokryshkin picked up the phone and started dialing the number. If consolidating central Siberia had taught him anything, it was that there was only one way to deal with radicals. They were so wrapped up in their own meaningless theories and ideologies they barely even lived in the real world, and that made them too dangerous to tolerate. They would be dragged out of their holes and brought into the light where the people of Russia could see them for what they were: not brave partisans, but desperate terrorists with no place in the new Russia."

Feodor said.\n\n"When he starts to bleed out, he calls his own blood reactionary and tells it to read more theory!" Lev laughed at his own joke, though Feodor was unamused. Seeing this, Lev tried again.\n\n"How do you know when you've killed a fascist?"\n\nFeodor glared at him\n\n"When he starts to bleed out, he calls you a Jew bastard and says his blood is too strong to leave his body!"\n\nOnce more Lev cackled at his own lack of wit, and once more Feodor remained silent. When Lev finished laughing Feodor spoke.\n\n"Have you ever killed anyone Lev?"\n\nLev looked at him, confused. "Maybe, I've fired my gun in combat a lot but I'm not sure."\n\n"Well, have you ever watched anyone bleed out?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Well I have. I've watched five men die. A communist, two anarchists, a fascist, and a Cossack. None of them talked about race or theory while they were dying.""

Machine guns sprayed death barely feet off the ground as the infantry sprang into action, pushing towards the structure in a text-book assault. Ducking into cover just before a dozen slugs which tore through the space that he had formerly occupied, the air went out of his chest. He took a few deep breaths and blinked his eyes once, twice, three times. Good enough. Firing a few bullets at the general direction of the structure, the Sargeant rolled left to join the rest of his unit, already going through the motions of the battle drill.\n\nThe screaming, shooting, and dying lasted all of five minutes before the white handkerchiefs went up, and the black-shirted figures stepped out in surrender, bodies surrounding the once picturesque cabin.

They were deep in the industrial district of Irkutsk, closing in on the worker's housing that dotted the outskirts of the factories. Their mission was a simple one, to root out elements of Yagoda's NKVD that had survived the strife in the Far-East.\n\nAs they approached their target, he motioned for his men to split into two teams. His team would breach the front of the enemy structure, an abandoned apartment complex. The second team, under the command of Lieutenant Ugolev, would be tasked with breaching the rear entry and preventing the enemy from making a retreat. Ivan approached the doorway into the building unmolested and had his men stack up on the doors. His men entered the building and were met with an eerie silence. The men went about securing the first floor and found nothing, there was no sign this floor had been inhabited in years.\n\nIvan left three men behind in the lobby to act as a rearguard and pressed forward towards the stairwell. This would be the most dangerous part of the operation, traversing the stairwell into the second and third floors. He crept up the stairs slowly, keeping watch for any sort of traps. It was as he ascended the last step that he heard the gunfire from the base of the stairs. They had used the elevator shaft to get behind them.\n\nIvan began to shout out orders but was cut off as he had to dive for cover as soldiers on the second floor opened fire. He was only able to take rare potshots at his assailants. He was able to drop one before being hit in the shoulder. His rifle clattered from his grasp and fell down the stairwell. He cursed and drew his sidearm, only to be perforated by fire from a man on the stairs above him.\n\nIvan's body tumbled onto his men below. Before the NKVD could celebrate, the rear team made their appearance. The communists were defeated, but it was a pyrrhic victory at best."

Large numbers of insurgents and dissidents have been captured or killed, enormous quantities of material have been captured, and insurgent leadership has been greatly compromised.\n\nConcurrently, elements of state government have returned to, or been established in, areas declared secured from partisan influence. This has not only returned life to normal for millions of our citizens, but greatly strengthened our control of, and extraction from, the regions in question.\n\nHowever, we must take care to not grow complacent. Though activity has, through vigorous and sometimes bloody action, decreased, fanatical elements do remain, and they are still to be considered extremely dangerous.\n\nWe must stay the course.

To help distribute supplies, provide order and, of course, secure the land for the state. It also offered pay. Pay far in excess of what Ruslan could earn selling vegetables. And, so, after seeing his father to market he had walked towards the enlistment booth set up in the square.\n\nHis father had not been happy, but he had, in the end, understood.

Every day, ships from all around the Pacific carrying sailors and traders from all around the world stop at the docks, loading or unloading cargo into or out of their storages, with hired help always available from the people of Magadan if they need it.\n\nThis success in its function as a port has made Magadan a key part of the Federal economy, bringing great wealth into Siberia and enriching all involved in the industry. At the same time, the promise of riches and greatness has attracted many from across the Federation to the city, making Magadan grow and even blossom.

He woke every morning in the pitch dark, marched until he was exhausted, instructed and then tested on the lessons afterwards, shoveled as much food down as possible, and then fell into an exhausted sleep. Only to repeat the process the next day.\n\nDespite the hardship, however, Ruslan could not say that he hated the experience. He was learning skills, both military and organizational, and was making many friends besides. Friends from all over the region, from areas he had only ever heard of in passing, and they were fascinating.\n\nHe could not wait until he completed training, and got a chance to see the lands of whatever region he was assigned to.

Margelov could barely make out the words, however, too lost in his own thoughts. As confident as he was in their ability, only more hardship awaited them now as they began to move west. He was confident that they were ready, of course. The question was, would being ready be enough? There was no way of knowing if even the best of Russia's soldiers could win the wars to come, and more importantly, which of them would make it back alive.\n\nAs the man before him finished his report, Margelov nodded and sent him off, to be alone with his thoughts and anxieties."

Finally, Pokryshkin and his corporate backers, who in their endless pursuit of stability and wealth, had forgotten the average Russian.\n\nThere would be no more of that, not on his watch. Some may have sympathized with his cause - Sibir, and their backers - but Feniks, Titan, and the rest of them were venal, corrupt, heartless, ruled by a hundred would-be dictators. To hell with them. The supremacy of the corporations, the rise of the Siloviki, the bastardization of the Federation's ideals, those had been the final straws, the acts which made good people stand up and retake their destiny.\n\nAnd so he spoke. "Fellow citizens, I have not come to begin a revolution. I have come to fulfill the ideals of which we have not forgotten!"\n\nThe crowd cheered wildly.\n\nHe smiled, basking in the love of his fellow citizens.

Workers protections, new regulations encompassing lobbying, and other vectors of corporate influence, stringent antitrust laws. It wouldn't be enough to defang the corporations, not by a long shot. Their influence reached far too deep for a mere piece of legislation to reverse the impact of a decade of unfettered exploitation, but it was a start.\n\nThe corporate giants, and Pokryhkin's clique, would fight them every step of the way. Their lackeys in the Duma, and the Siloviki who had long been paid off with corporate gold. Shukshin, however, had the will of the people-and the power of the Presidency-on his side."

 PAV_superregional.12.desc:0 "It was early in the morning when the two men met in one of the many rooms of the Presidential palace, flames flickering in the fireplace, snowmelt falling from the frost-covered roof. The new and former President of the Siberian Federation glancing at each other uneasily. They had been friends once, comrades in arms during the final days of the Republic. Those days were gone, a friendship strained and broken amidst the rise of the Federation.\n\n"Where did it all go wrong Vasily? Where did we lose our way." Shukshin glanced up at Pokryshkin's voice, the Falcon of Siberia staring down into his drink. There was no malice in eyes, no resentment, just a colorless pallor, and a resigned expression.\n\nShukshin stared at his own drink, for he had no response. No answer to the question that he himself had pondered on many a sleepless night. He could still faintly remember the optimism in the Federation's early days, the final break from the decaying Republic amidst the chaos of the Siberian War and Anarchist revolt. A time where the Federation seemed to have a place for everybody, regardless of ideology or wealth. Before the corruption and cynicism set in, before the rise of the Siloviki and the Corporations.\n\nHe could point to many a time where he or Pokryshkin should've stepped in, should've moved to reign in the excesses of the system. But, the Federation itself was a reaction, a result of the failed idealism of the poets and artists in Tomsk. Perhaps the cynicism which arose in idealism's place was simple yet another inevitable, another result of the Republic's failure.\n\nShukshin looked back up at his compatriot, the Falcon was waiting for an answer, and so he spoke the honest truth."

He had been confirmed as the President of the Federation against all of his detractors. The President smiled as he sipped on an aged brandy from his private stock.\n\nThe election had been the death knell of the Federalist cause. Shukshin had been ousted from his position, with his good friend Mikhail Devyatayev taking up the position once occupied by the bleeding heart mayor. With another drink he thought of his next moves. He would have to ensure that the Federalists were completely shut out of power. They would need to be replaced by men loyal to the cause of the Federation, strong men who would provide stability for the state. A return to business as usual was essential, as now that he had been confirmed he would need to consolidate the power of the executive.\n\nLooking out over the city, Alexander took another sip and leaned back in his chair. The election had ensured that the legitimacy of the silovik system had been cemented in the public consciousness. Indeed, the failure of the federalists was the best thing that could have happened for his regime.\n\nAlexander raised his glass to the window and gave a small toast to himself and the Federation."

Already seated were representatives of the big three corporations in the Federation. As he took his seat, he helped himself to the offered drink and practically ignored the other men at the table. When he was ready, he motioned for the men to begin the meeting. "Thank you for joining us, Mr. President. We understand how busy your schedule is and appreciate this meeting," a well groomed man from Sibir began. After the usual pleasantries were observed, business began in earnest.\n\n"Gentlemen, the Federation's recent acquisition of the Russian Far-East has opened up to us a whole new area for profit. What the region lacks in population it more than makes up for in the sheer bounty of natural resources," Pokryshkin began.\n\n"Indeed, the region has a vast potential for the expansion of our operations, and the profits therein. The question, I suppose, must be on the distribution of this vast material wealth. All of our companies have interest in the lands of the Far-East, after all." The Sibir man glared at the representative from Titan as he spoke. In order to head off any argument, the President spoke.\n\n"Gentlemen, as with all of our acquisitions, you shall have a say in the distribution of the land. So long as your financial departments can afford. I believe we shall first speak of the lands around the city of Irkutsk, as they are ripe for exploitation."\n\nThe meeting progressed as smoothly as previous meetings had, and by the end of it the President had made many profitable deals with the men, enough to ensure the economy of the Federation continued to flourish, at least."

He leaned back in his chair after a long day, having only just finished the day's paperwork, and sipped a glass of wine. As he sat there, stewing in his own thoughts, his mind drifted back to better days. He remembered his days flying high in the air over the battle lines, fighting for the glory of Bukharin's Union. He remembered the pride he took in the ideals of the Union, the brotherhood of all its people, and the optimism that had consumed them all in those days.\n\nBefore he could get too invested in the nostalgia, however, he remembered the worst parts of those days. He could remember the despair of the Great Patriotic War, the fear and terror he felt as the Germans just kept pushing no matter what he did. The feelings of despair as he fought a desperate war in the air as his friends and countrymen died on the ground, knowing there was nothing he could that could turn the tide. Most of all he remembered the death of the Union's ideals when the Germans pushed to the AA Line and the union fell.\n\nThe ideals of those days could not last before the onslaught of the fascists. Even in the aftermath, when the Central Siberian Republic was whole and strong, it could not be said that the grand ideals of the past had succeeded. Yet, his ideals had not truly faded until the Federation began its march for a strong Russia.\n\nAlexander shook his head, dismissing the musings of the past. The old days were behind him and thoughts of a free Russia had been dismissed for good reason. What Russia needed was strength and stability at any cost. At his core he knew this to be true."

Skyscrapers towered over the city, filled with the new ruling class of Russia: the Oligarchs, the overseers of his new Russia. This truly was the paradise for the Siloviks.\n\nHowever, as Alexander continued to stare from his office down below, he also saw those who benefited the least from his system. Ragged workers walked to and fro towards the factories on the outskirts of the city. Those unemployed could be seen laying about in the streets, begging for money only to be cleared out by the police and forced to go somewhere else other than the upper districts. Memories of Shukshin's cries for a fair and just Russia filled Alexander's mind, which only made him chuckle. That man was a shell, a broken man forced back to the bottle he hated so much for Shukshin and his posse had failed to realize one, singular truth about Russia.\n\nRussia was a harsh nation, and it needed to a strongman to bring it to progress and modernity.\n\nAnd Russia needed to be strong and stable for what was to come. The Germans still had their steely grip on Moscow and Russians suffered under them. They deserved to be a part of Russia, for they are true born Russians, not colonial subjects of a regime of a foreign nation. He would receive what belonged to the Federation back no matter what, no matter the cost.\n\nThe machine of Russia had been broken time and time again, but he had fixed the machine. Now, he orchestrated a symphony of machines, working together for his grand designs for his nation. He couldn't help but smile as he sat down once again in his chair, and toasted the victory to come."

They were cleaner now, thanks to new regulations, and he could see several families picnicking along the river's banks.\n\nShukshin allowed himself a small drink as he took in the sight, remembering his excursion to the waterfront nearly a decade ago. Unchecked corporate excess and institutional corruption, a government-run by and for local strongmen. He had changed all that; no longer did corporate greed dictate policy and law, no longer were the working class squeezed for every penny. There was still much to be done, of course, fairer regulations, the issue of Pokryshkin's clique, increased federalization, and the ever-pressing matter of hated Germans.\n\nYet, as he saw workers joking around in the fields just beyond the river and families enjoying a vacation for the first time in years, Shukshin felt something stir inside of him. The idealism which was once so infectious in the early days of the Central Siberian Republic. He was doing this for them, for the people, for Russia, all of Russia, not just those born into power, those blessed by circumstance. He remembered those days, the headiness and optimism, and how everything fell apart under the strain of the Siberian War, and the fighting against the Anarchists, the food riots, the shootings.\n\nHe poured himself another drink as the morning sun rose high in the sky. The CSR may have fallen under the strain of war, but the Federation-his Federation-was different, stronger, and more robust, yet no less concerned for the welfare of its citizens.\n\nIt was different than the CSR.

Additionally, improvements to missile speed have greatly expanded the response time of anti-air emplacements while the extended range has allowed them to project a much wider zone of control in the skies over our cities.\n\nThough Novosibirsk was never reached by the terror bombing that plagued the lands to our west, our people still lived in constant fear of the day dark planes filled our skies and bombs blotted out the sun.

For years our air force and those of the other warlords have been almost totally defensive in nature, more focused on beating back air raids than launching our own. This is finally beginning to change.\n\nEarly tests have shown that the M-50 is an extremely promising candidate as a next generation strategic bomber. Its four engines allow it to move at high speeds for an aircraft of its size and it is able to achieve extremely high altitudes, making it a difficult target for all but the heaviest anti-aircraft systems to hit. Even at high altitudes it is able to deliver its bomb load with extreme precision, comparable to the accuracy of the best bombers in the German air fleet. With the proper training and escorts, a squadron of these planes could rain hell on our enemies and escape without a scratch. When the time comes to reclaim the west from Germany, the M-50 will have what it takes to make the Germans regret thinking they could bomb us with impunity all those years ago."

That is what our engineers have told us after the first series of test runs for the M-50 prototype have exposed several major design flaws. Due to the bulk of the plane, additional engines had to be incorporated into the design to allow it to reach its target speed. The additional bulk of the engine reduced the plane's aerodynamic profile, making it less maneuverable and more vulnerable to interceptor aircraft. Additional issues with the bomb deployment mechanism made accurate targeting highly difficult.\n\nDespite the multitude of problems that have rendered the M-50 an unusable design, our engineers have managed to salvage some of the more innovative ideas incorporated into the prototype. The tests proved that the concept of high-altitude strategic bombing is both possible and achievable with an improved design, and with better engines it should be possible to produce a strategic bomber that is capable of achieving high speeds without issue.

Issues in the first design were spotted and had to be corrected, then extra weight had to be accounted for. Several air frames had been built and disposed of after more issues were spotted. In the end, after months of stress and work by dozens of engineers and designers, the project had spent almost twice its original budget before a prototype was completed and ready to fly. It would all be worth it as long as the test was successful.\n\nAs the bomber climbed into the sky the men collected in the control tower watched nervously. The pilot read off readings at predetermined intervals, rattling off his air speed, temperature inside the cabin, fuel burn rate, and more. Everything seemed to be going well. One engineer breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThe left wing started to visibly wobble. The pilot reported the plane was beginning to turn and shake outside of his control. The captain in the control tower grabbed the microphone and began to rattle off instructions when they all watched the wing tear off completely.

To offset this disadvantage, it is heavily armored, leading some of the test pilots to dub it the flying tank." As opposed to the rapid strike tactics of most attack helicopters, the Mi-24's pilots have been encouraged to adopt a new strategy of aggressive, prolonged engagements with ground forces, relying on their heavy weaponry to mow down enemy soldiers and vehicles alike while their armor soaks up any incoming fire."

 PAV_elections.0.desc:0 "As the elections for the federation ramp up, it's become clear that despite Alexander Pokryshkin's prior political ascendancy, that he's been challenged to that very ascendancy by none other than Vasily Shukshin, the mayor of Barnaul.\n\nBoth men occupy highly prestigious and very important positions within the federation, but over the years have come to represent two very different currents of thought in regards to the federation itself. Alexander Pokryshkin, the man that "saved the federation from itself" and engineered its highly successful ascent, has campaigned on a platform of economic expansion, national stability, and measured patriotism.\n\nVasily Shukshin, on the other hand, represents the opposition to Pokryshkin's monopoly on power. Comprised of locals from Barnaul, supporters of a liberal democratic federation, and dissenters-turned-traitors from Pokryshkin's camp, Shukshin's platform is focused around political reform and an emphasis of a return to the roots - culturally and politically - especially in regards to remembering the origin of the federation and a distaste for tyranny.\n\nAs each respective political player begins their campaign, only time will tell which of the two will come out on top."

For months, the fate of the Siberian Federation had hung in the balance as the federation's current leader, the corporate status quo President Alexander Pokryshkin, has faced off against a challenge by the former mayor of Barnaul, the democratic Vasily Shukshin. They had dueled in the streets, in the farms, in the barracks, in the very hearts and minds of the people. Everyone knew that whoever won this election, it would determine if the Federation remained in its corporate state status quo or if the Federation would turn a new corner into democracy, a concept the Federation lay unfamiliar with.\n\nAnd so, as they gathered around their radios, bought the morning newspapers and even gathered around the few TVs dotted about the country, they waited with bated breath to hear what would happen to their homeland. Every man, woman, and child sat with baited breath as the newscaster began to speak.\n\n"Hello citizens of the Siberian Federation, this is Nikolai Potemkin of Siberian News Now! Today, I am proud to announce that the winner of yesterday's election and the leader of our glorious Federation is...,"\n\n"President Alexander Pokryshkin!"\n\nSilence filled the homes and crowds of the Federation. Only a scant few in the government and the higher echelons of the companies partied at the news. The people knew what this meant: same old same old, and so, the Siberian Federation would remain the brutal, cynical, corporate state that it always had been, for on this day..."

Shukshin's workplace was not that. It was not quite a walk-in closet, but it wasn't far off. Shukshin noticed the military man looking around with a puzzled expression and chuckled.\n\n"I know it isn't much, but when you're challenging the incumbent President from within his own government, it isn't a surprise when your accommodations get suddenly downgraded."\n\nSultan nodded. "My current office has a nice view of the river. I suppose I shouldn't get too attached to it in case this meeting becomes public knowledge."\n\nShukshin grinned and nodded. "Speaking of, I have another meeting in a few minutes so let's get down to business. I don't want you to risk that view for nothing."\n\n"Very well," Sultan said, holding out a file he'd held under his arm. "This is a list of officers in the military that I believe might be sympathetic to our cause. Take a look and let me know who you want me to contact."\n\nShukshin opened the file and glanced over the list of names. "Do you trust these men?" he asked.\n\nSultan hesitated before he spoke. "They are all talented and loyal to the Federation. Some I trust more than others, which I mention in the file, but I think all of them are at least potentially persuadable."\n\nShukshin nodded. "Very good. That's all for now, I'll get back to you tomorrow with a list of who I want to contact first."\n\nSultan turned to walk out of the tiny office. There was work to be done."

I've spent many hours taking it in, thinking about anything or nothing. At least the sacrifice shall not have been in vain."\n\nShukshin glanced over at him, curiously.\n\nSultan continued. "I've found fifteen other officers who are willing to endorse you publicly. Most are from the army but a few are from the air force and we even got one promising candidate from the naval academy. Now eight of them, including the ones from the air force, are only willing to endorse as a group. Strength in numbers I suppose, but an endorsement is an endorsement. This should be enough to show the people that the military isn't one hundred percent behind Pokryshkin, and it'll help with you being criticized for being too weak on foreign policy."\n\nShukshin grinned. "Fifteen" he murmured. "I thought we'd be lucky to get ten."\n\n"The army is tired of playing second fiddle to the air force" Sultan replied "And the air force wants to hedge its bets in case you win."\n\nShukshin nodded. "Thank you, Amet-Khan. You've done better than I ever could have hoped. If I win you can have whatever office you'd like."\n\nSultan turned his eyes back to the river, a small smile on his face."

He had been waiting for half an hour, performing meaningless tasks to keep himself occupied while his eyes continued to drift over to the phone. It had been a long day, and a long night too, but the phone call he was waiting for would determine whether he went to bed pleased or disappointed. He had ruled out going to sleep before the call. Even if it wasn't unprofessional, his nerves would not have let him.\n\nSuddenly the phone clattered to life, and despite the long wait it still caught Shukshin by surprise. He hurriedly picked it up and said one word. "Sultan"\n\n"Mr Shukshin" Amat-Khan Sultan replied from the other end. "I apologize for the delay. I was trying to work something out at the last minute before I called." His tone was professional, but there was a hint of disappointment in his voice it couldn't fully cover.\n\n"I take it you didn't get anyone then." Shukshin sighed.\n\n"Worse, I got an influential army captain by the name of Pokroskov. He and several of his comrades were ready to endorse you but he made too much noise and was found out. He was discharged and replaced within the hour and now no one will even speak to me, not if it puts their careers on the line."\n\nShukshin couldn't hold back the long sigh that followed. "That's... disappointing. Thank you for your efforts Sultan, I know you did your best and things got out of hand."\n\n"I appreciate that, sir." Sultan replied. "I will keep trying and I am still willing to endorse you, but I'd advise your future campaign strategies not rely on any support from the military. Good night."\n\nThe line went dead.

 PAV_elections.4.desc:0 "On a normal night, the Barnaul Theater would be hosting a local musician or an amateur dramatic company debuting a new production, and it would draw a decent audience of the residents of the city whose name the theater bore. But this was no normal night. The main event was not scheduled to start for two more hours and there were already lines around the block. As soon as the doors opened people excitedly filed in, taking any seat they could find. Within half an hour of opening its doors, the Barnaul had to close them again. For the first time in decades, every seat in the house was full. Even the standing room in the back was packed solid.\n\nThe excited chattering of the audience suddenly quieted as the lights winked, then dimmed, a sign that things were about to begin. From backstage Vasily Shukshin took one last deep breath, patted the speech in his pocket, and walked out into the light. The silent theater immediately roared back to life, all 2,500 people there clapping and cheering for him before he'd even said a word. As he took the podium, he couldn't help but grin like an idiot. "Thank you, Barnaul!" he said, the speakers allowing him to make himself heard over the clamor.\n\nThe speech was supposed to last thirty minutes but with the audience cheering and chanting it stretched to almost an hour. Additional speakers outside the theater delivered Shukshin's words to the even larger crowd outside on the streets. The next morning the headline in every major newspaper in the federation was about Shukshin's rally. Most touted it as a huge victory, a massive sign of enthusiasm for the opposition candidate. Even papers loyal to Pokryshkin couldn't help but acknowledge that the rally had been a success for his opponent."

 PAV_elections.5.desc:0 "Dmitry Glinka read over the memo he'd just received. It came straight from Pokryshkin, and stamped across the top in bold red letters were the words TOP SECRET. Very subtle, Glinka thought to himself. He'd been expecting this memo, or one like it, for quite a while. Pokryshkin was in a reelection campaign and according to the polls it was closer than anyone suspected it could have been at the start of the race. If the boss wanted to be certain of victory, he would have to stop playing nice and get down in the mud, or at least send someone in for him. It seemed that responsibility had fallen on the SB. It made sense that it would. After all, dirty work was what they did best.\n\nGlinka was surprised by the plain wording of the letter. He was used to politicians beating around the bush and trying to maintain a degree of plausible deniability when asking for his help. Pokryshkin had made no such effort here, meaning he was either braver, dumber, or more desperate that Glika had assumed. The order said plainly that the SB was to investigate the leading figures of the opposition and find any secrets from their past they might be trying to conceal from voters. Even more plainly, it said that if the SB could not find sufficient evidence of any scandals, it was authorized to fabricate some in order to "Preserve the stability of the federation."\n\nGlinka chuckled. He'd already dug into Shukshin and most of his cronies, and they were all as clean as a whistle. If only he'd been working for them, he would have had no trouble at all bringing Pokryshkin's corruption to light, but that was not the way things had worked out, was it? The president was the one who paid him, and it was time to earn his keep. Shukshin was running to the left of Pokryshkin on several major issues. That was as good a place to start as any."

 PAV_elections.51.desc:0 "SHUKSHIN ACCUSED OF WORKING WITH COMMUNIST AGENTS!\n\nA NEW RED MENACE FOR RUSSIA?\n\nOPPOSITION CAMPAIGN MANAGER ARRESTED!\n\nIgor looked over the newspapers, trying to decide which one he wanted. He usually preferred the Morning Post, but recently it had appointed a new editor and had been slowly becoming a mouthpiece for Pokryshkin's government. Not that that mattered today. Every paper, even the ones that were usually anti-government, was carrying a story about Shukshin speaking to some socialist labor leaders last week or about his campaign manager benign arrested yesterday. Igor was already caught up on the communist story so he grabbed the paper with the article on the campaign manager, paid the vendor, and took a seat at a bench.\n\nThe article detailed the arrest and charging of the campaign manager. Apparently, he'd been caught involved in some corrupt dealings trying to rig vote collection in a precinct near Tomsk. He'd already been released on bail but his trial was scheduled for only a week before an election and the newspaper speculated that he would probably be replaced in the coming days. Shukshin, for his part, denied all of the charges and accused the government of fabricating the evidence to disrupt his election bid. Igor was surprised by that. Sure, everyone knew the government was corrupt, but it wouldn't go as far as to just make up evidence would it?\n\nIgor put the paper away and sighed. He didn't normally follow politics, but he had recently. He used to think every politician was just a corrupt, dishonest man looking to make his money off the work of the common people, but Shukshin had made him reconsider that belief. He'd sounded like he genuinely wanted to help in his speeches and writings, but it seemed that he and his allies were just as deceitful as the people in charge right now. If that was the case, Igor thought, he would probably just not bother voting this time either. If nothing would change, what was the point?"

Not that it mattered, they were all telling the same story, the only story anyone was talking about today. A memo supposedly written by President Pokryshkin to the head of the SB had been leaked. No one but the leaker knew how it got out, but now the front page of every newspaper bore the same picture of a note with the words TOP SECRET printed atop it in bright red and bearing the President's signature at the bottom. The contents of the letter were brief but clear. The SB was ordered to go digging into the past of Shukshin and his associates looking for scandals, and to make some up if they couldn't find any real ones.\n\nIgor picked a paper he knew had a cartoonist he liked and settled in to read further. Shukshin was accusing the President of corrupt and tyrannical behavior, and was calling on the people of the federation to turn out and vote to reject this sort of treatment. Pokryshkin, for his part, was denying everything and dismissed the story as a hoax by the opposition to portray him as a dictator. He had refused to comment on the fact that the signature on the letter matched his perfectly, and it appeared to have been printed on notarized paper from his office.\n\nIgor felt himself getting angrier and angrier as he read the story. He'd known Pokryshkin was corrupt, but he never thought he'd stoop as low as trying to frame his opponent. Igor was not normally a political man. He considered most politicians to be liars and thieves regardless of party or position, but the President had gone too far this time. Igor had heard some of Shukshin's speeches, and he'd been interested but he hadn't made up his mind until now. The election was coming soon, and when it arrived, he'd be sure to cast his ballot for the man that deserved to lead Russia, not the one leading it now"
