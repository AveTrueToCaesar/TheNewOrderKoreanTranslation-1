 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_POKRYSHKIN_DESC:0 "제2차 세계대전의 전설적인 에이스 조종사이자 소련의 영웅인 알렉산더 이바노비치 포크리슈킨은 전쟁이 끝난 후 그의 고향인 노보시비르스크로 돌아갔습니다. 비교적 평화로운 삶을 살길 바랬던 그는 운명이 그를 어디로 이끄는지 알지 못했습니다.\n\n포크리슈킨은 중앙 시베리아 공화국의 통치에 만족했고, 결국 공화국 정부에 들어갔습니다. 공화국 하의 노보시비르스크 시를 관리하는 일은 시베리아 전쟁 전까지만 해도 비교적 간단한 일이었습니다. 하지만, 야고다가 이끄는 강력한 동쪽의 최고 소비에트를 상대하기 위해 그는 도시 전역을 전시체제로 탈바꿈시켜야 했습니다. 배급제가 도입되었고, 시의 수많은 젊은이들이 징병되어 시베리아 전장의 총알받이로 보내졌습니다. 어느 순간, 그는 한계에 도달했고, 바르나울 시장 바실리 슈크신과 접촉한 후 그는 계획을 실행에 옮겼습니다.\n\n 두 사람과 부하들은 노보시비르스크를 신속히 점령하여, 어느 외부 영향도 받지 않고, 러시아의 혼란상 속에서 홀로 서있는 진정으로 독립적인 정부를 설립했습니다. 이제 그는 바르나울과의 불안한 동맹을 통해 시를 통치하고 있고, 그의 도시를 안정화시킬 필요가 있어 보입니다. 많은 인구를 보유한 노보시비르스크는 산업과 기능적 농업의 중심지이지만, 여전히 내적, 외적 측면에서 직면해야 할 문제들이 있으며, 이를 해결하는 것은 포크리슈킨에게 달려 있습니다."

 POLITICS_VASILY_SHUKSHIN_DESC:0 "1929년 알타이 크라이에서 태어난 바실리 마카로비치 슈크신은 촉망받는 작가였고, 정치에 발을 담그고 바르나울 시장에 당선됩니다. 그는 오랫동안 끝없는 길을 걸어왔습니다 : 연방이 중앙 시베리아 공화국에서 막 분리독립했을 때 포크리슈킨의 옛 동맹이었던 바실리는, 그의 연방주의, 민주주의 이상과 동떨어진 부패를 일삼았던 그의 옛 동맹과 사업 동료들과 충돌했습니다. 하지만 그 또한 머릿속으론 이상주의를 내세웠지만 연방 대통령이 되기 위해 막후거래와 협상을 일삼았죠.\n\n이제 실로비키로부터 국가 통치권을 빼앗은 바실리는 더이상 뒤에서 편안히 앉아있지 않기로 결정했습니다. 실로비키는 힘을 잃었지만, 기업들의 부패는 공화국에 막대한 해를 끼치고 있기 때문입니다.\n\n민주주의의 사막이었던 러시아에 꽃이 피게 하려면 그는 그의 대통령 재임기간 동안 기업들이 야기한 문제들을 해결해 나가야 할 것입니다."

 ### Ideas ###
 PAV_Disproportionate_Population:0 "인구 불균형"
 PAV_Disproportionate_Population_desc:0 "노보시비르스크는 극동 지역의 중심지로서 시베리아 횡단철도의 중요한 통행지여서 우랄 산맥 전역에 걸쳐 항상 가장 발달하고 인구밀도가 높은 지역 중 하나입니다. 이 도시는 대조국전쟁이 발발했을 때에도 시베리아에서 가장 큰 도시 중 하나였고 전쟁으로 인해 도시가 더욱 커지게 되었습니다.\n\n수천 명의 사람들이 독일의 점령지 혹은 러시아에서의 혼란에서 벗어나 민간인들로 북적이는 노보시비르스크에 도착하였습니다. 이것은 축복이자 저주이지만, 우리가 안고 함께 살아가야만 하는 것입니다."

 PAV_The_All_Siberian_Army_desc:0 "노보시비르스크의 보호를 책임지는 군대는 중앙시베리아의 가장 강력하고 명망있는 군대 중 하나입니다. 시베리아의 매가 톰스크 정부로부터 갈라져 자신과 백성들을 전쟁의 참상에서 구했을때, 중앙시베리아 공화국 군대의 상당수가 포크리슈킨에게 충성을 맹세했고, 남쪽에서 재편성 되었습니다.\n\n전 시베리아 군대는 노보시비르스크의 거대한 이웃 국가들과 견줄 수 있는 군대로 개혁되었으며, 많은 사람들이 대조국 전쟁과 시베리아 전쟁에서 얻은 숙련도는 귀중한 것으로 널리 퍼졌습니다."

 PAV_Untouched_Industry_desc:0 "러시아의 많은 군벌들과는 달리, 노보시비르스크는 운 좋게도 거대하고 온전한 산업기반을 가지고 있습니다. 노보시비르스크가 독일 폭격기들이 폭격을 가하는 구역 밖에 있는 것과 더불어 독일 침공 당시 구 소련의 생산력을 우랄에서 신속하게 철수시킨 것이 이 같은 사실의 주요 원인입니다.\n\n바르나울의 농업 생산력까지 고려한다면, 왜 우리가 가장 발전된 군벌 국가 중 하나로 여겨지고 어떠한 적보다 우위를 점할 수 있는 이유가 분명합니다."
 PAV_The_Great_Opioid_Epidemic:0 "아편양제제 유행병"
 PAV_The_Great_Opioid_Epidemic_desc:0 "마약은 러시아의 군벌에서는 찾아보기 어렵지만, 노보시비르스크는 많은 사람들에게 불법 물질 거래에 참여할 수 있는 기회를 제공했습니다. 인구가 많고 경제가 선진화되면서 중앙정부는 그러한 제품이 유통되는 암시장을 퇴치하는 문제들에 직면해 있습니다.\n\n문제가 걷잡을 수 없이 계속 커지면서 지역사회에 더 큰 영향을 미치기 시작하였으며, 노보시비르스크에 마약중독이 점차 커지고 있습니다."

It is vital that we have a fighter capable of competing with anything the Germans, Japanese, or Americans can field. A new design, dubbed the MiG-23, may be just what we are looking for. Sporting variable wing geometry and an experimental radar system, it will be one of the most advanced aircraft in the world."

 PAV_project_2:0 "프로젝트 §OBERKUT§!"
 PAV_project_2_desc:0 "There is more to controlling the skies than having the best planes. Land-based aircraft are vital to defending our cities and production centers from air raids, and Russia's aerial defenses are woefully inadequate to defend against a modern bombing fleet. The solution lies in developing a system of surface-to-air guided missiles similar to those of our rivals around the globe. A prototype missile, the S-25, is a strong candidate to lead the next generation of Russian anti-aircraft weapons."

Our current fleet of bombers would be chewed to pieces if they ever tried to raid Germania or Tokyo, but we cannot concede the opportunities presented by strategic bombing of the enemy homeland. A new, supersonic long-range bomber is needed. One design we have received, the M-50, promises to deliver exactly that."

The Federation's economy is still developing because of it, with new factories continuing to open, advancements being made in construction technology and the expansion of infrastructure across the state.\n\nAll of these factors have greatly improved our industrial efficiency, allowing us to produce a greater volume of equipment for our military, bringing us another step closer to national reunification."

Put simply, as our population has inflated, our production of grain has not. This issue is rapidly becoming the greatest crisis in Novosibirsk, besides the enduring pandemic.\n\nFortunately, the plan our government has come up with deals with both the food shortage and the disproportionate population, by resettling refugees in farmsteads where the land is yet to be cultivated.

At midday, when the civil servants go to lunch, the President and his Siloviks tour the country, seeking support. However, like the Tsars, Emperors, General Secretaries, and Premiers before him, his power was never in question.

The Central Siberian Republic, the culmination of this blazing passion, shattered as soon as the wind blew against the course of their destination.\n\nFrom our sanctuary in the heart of Siberia, the Federation marched out, triumphing over the remnants of the Central Siberian Republic. For here, we shall say: no, to the brutality of idealism. No, to the senseless waste of ideology. No, to the unbridled rage of humane passion.

The Narodniks, Communists, Anarchists, Idealists, Rurikids - all are priests of false gods masquerading as an intent of human innovation and improvement. Nothing they offer could enlighten a person to his sovereignty. The noise and din offer nothing but flirtations with the meaningless.\n\nThe Federation has embraced the silence.

It used to be the case that legislation like this would be shot down immediately before even going to a vote, but this is no longer the case.\n\nPresident Shukshin will place his full support behind this law, and encourage his supporters to do the same. On paper, it really is little more than a token effort, but it will signal to the whole nation that Shukshin is no crony of the corporations.

Vast expanses, laden with resources, people, and strategic positions. Expanses that would, in time, fall under the Federation's control.\n\nIt was only natural, he continued, that the Federation, with Novosibirsk at its heart, possessed a special destiny not seen elsewhere in Siberia. It was the largest city east of the Urals, formed a critical junction on the primary route of travel across Siberia, and lay in a major region of development of Bukharin's Siberian plan.\n\nWas it not, he concluded, therefore logical that the Federation would leverage those advantages to reclaim lands rightfully belonging to it? Further, having accomplished that goal, was it not similarly logical that the Federation would continue expansion, over all of Siberia?\n\nOf course it was, Pokryshkin thundered. It was not only logical, it was inevitable. It was right. The Federation had a destiny, a right, to unite Siberia. It would do so. And on that great day, would it stop? No, he said decisively. It would continue pursuing its final destiny - dominion over all of Russia.\n\nWhen he was finished, all applauded. All agreed that it had been a fine speech.

It was clear they meant business, and in Novosibirsk, there was little more valuable than meaning business.\n\nA few people whispered, here and there; a friend of a friend had said this or that about the government wanting to eradicate terrorism, and that the police presence was to keep an eye on the ordinary people that the Narodniks blended into so easily. Soon, the whole street knew the news, then the streets nearby, and by the end of the day everyone in the city knew they might be unknowingly watched at any moment. For once, all the complaints of the citizenry was silenced, all their usual bravery frozen in place.

The spider's web had begun to feel more like a safety net for the common person.\n\nAs for the uncommon person- the Narodnik, the spy, the common thief- the spider quickly began to feast.

The Nazi jackboot had fallen on them over twenty years ago, and showed no signs of being lifted anytime soon.\n\nIndeed, from what little news had reached Central Siberia from those lands, the entire peninsula had been treated as a colonial project by the German Kriegsmarine, and his people had, as would have been expected, suffered terribly. To those few countrymen he had spoken to over the years, there was little hope of ever changing this, and for a long time he had thought the same.\n\nBut the aircraft he now sat in had changed those thoughts. The Federation had many challenges, yes, but unlike many of the states around it, it was still innovating. It was still designing. While others looked to the past, it was looking forward - socially, technically, economically, and militarily.

He would find a perch on the rocks, gazing out at the gently rippling waters and listening to the distant cries of birds over the murmur of the river. Idle thoughts would drift lazily through his head or on some days, he would scribble away at some unborn writing project, or simply lay upon the shore in a half asleep stupor dreaming of things to come.\n\nNow, however, things were changing. The waters were getting filthier by the day as more businesses moved into town, raising factories and more along Ob's bay. Although the Federation, and Shukshin's own values, lay based upon freedom, he could not help but feel perhaps it was leniency that had allowed these industrialists to lay claim to his home. In several meetings, Shukshin had brought up his misgivings with the direction of the town's development only to find many of his trusted aides in the pocket of the very same hounds preying upon Barnaul's newfound prosperity. Thus, he went out to the River once again to think. Shukshin felt conflicted with the idea of pushing the pocketed officials out, as each had gotten there through their own merit. Part of him felt it was vanity, the idea of holding something as trivial as the beauty of the nostalgic river over his own values. In the fields just beyond the river, however, he saw men breaking their backs for a day's wage dropped like crumbs by richer men. Was this corruption, in and of itself, a greater tyranny?\n\nStill, he would have to tackle this problem some other way. But how, when it felt only he could see Russia's pain?"

The patrol had followed the little game trail through the Altay forest for hours, assuming they were once again following a lead long cold. But there it was, squatting in the shadows of the trees like a withered hag\n\n"Well, boys," said Lytkin, his breath misting slightly in the cold mountain air, "shall we knock?" The patrol advanced, weapons held at the ready, bodies hunched low. Boris, rifle aloft, stepped carefully through the underbrush, eyes searching the treeline and ears pricked for any unusual sounds. He should have looked down.\n\nIt was an old weapon, buried in the fallen leaves and primed with a short length of wire. The Germans had called them S-Mines, the Russians, frog-mines. A short 'crumpf' sound issued from the ground as the mine launched itself to the height of Boris' belly.\n\nThe Russian's eyes bulged obscenely, pure terror contorting his face. A microsecond later, the mine exploded, throwing thousands of steel balls hurtling through the air and through Boris. The patrolman was gutted in an instant, the other soldiers flinging themselves to the ground. Lytkin screamed for everyone to stop moving, having to yell over Boris' gurgled howls as he died in pieces.\n\nFear, cold and icy, poured down their backs. They weren't alone up here."

It had been days (a week?) after Boris had died, and the Novosibirsk men had quickly fallen back into military form, knocking off the rust of their languor. Luka watched the building through his scope, a score of Narodniks in camo around the similarly painted building, eyes nervous and guns held close.\n\nA search of the cabin had revealed little, at first. After a lengthy search, the patrolmen had discovered the burned remnants of Narodnik documents in the fireplace indicating a new safehouse in the Altay. It had taken hours of painstakingly piecing the burned bits of paper back together, but now the patrolmen lay in wait for their enemy.\n\nLyktin, cigarette absent for once, raised his pistol, waving for his men to advance. They killed the first few terrorists with knives, spilling red onto the green. A firefight soon erupted, the crack and pop of rifles and pistols sending flocks of birds to take to the air. After a brief, but fierce, gun battle outside the building, the patrolmen assaulted the safehouse, breaching the metal door with grenades before rushing inside.\n\nThe actual battle took at most half an hour, but to Lyktin and his patrol, it had felt like an eternity. Luka was injured, a bloody shoulder, but nothing a few stitches and some vodka wouldn't fix.\n\nHands shaking, Lyktin reached down to grab a cigarette, but found that he couldn't feel his ever-present pack. He looked down, and was shocked to discover that the first two fingers of his left hand were gone. Lyktin stared at the bloody ruin of his hand, shock and adrenaline having shielded him from the pain. Numbly, he began to wrap it in a discarded shirt.

 PAV.21.desc:0 ""Don't let him get away!" the security man shouted on the top of his lungs as he hunted the assassin. "He's the one who tried to kill the President!" Despite all his efforts, there was little he could do to disperse the crowds that were fleeing in every direction after the sound of the two missed gunshots echoed in the Novosibirsk Square. He turned around once, to see Pokryshkin with his characteristic uniform being escorted by a squad of agents to safety, somewhere near his residence, but he could not lose track of the assassin as he headed into the narrow roads of the city. With all the energy he had left in him after this exhausting day of preparations, he ran as fast as he could, jumping over objects and pushing over civilians, but always keeping his eyes on the target. However, as he saw him reach the Oktyabrsky Bridge and jump over the railing, he shouted in vain one last time, as the killer fell into the freezing waters of the Ob River.\n\nTwo days later, Pokryshkin was in a highly classified meeting in the Presidential Residence, together with Security Minister Glinka. The proof had been laid in front of him, and it was as clear as day: the Narodniks were behind the recent attempt on his life. The trail of evidence had been followed by his trustworthy subordinates, and now it was time for justice to be served.\n\n"Sir, things are different now." Glinka's hesitation in his voice was obvious, but he continued nevertheless. "We thought the Narodniks were a simple nuisance to the Federation, a small group that could be rooted out. This assassination attempt proves the exact opposite - they are a credible threat with influence in the underworld, and one which will have to be dealt with. There are already security measures in place, but we must go further. We must launch a war against this terror."\n\nPokryshkin nodded in agreement."

Others, younger in age, were less decorated, but one could see their eagerness to work in their eyes.\n\n"My fellow NSB members, a looming threat has appeared, one threatening to tear apart what we have worked so hard to build." Glinka knew he had to speak decisively to get the message across. "The Narodniks, unconvinced by our noble state and institutions, continue to wage a campaign of terror and have, in fact, ramped up their efforts as has recently been made clear. It is our duty to restore order to these lands, and eliminate the red menace before it eliminates us. President Pokryshkin has outlined specific measures through which we can fight these radicals, and as leading NSB officials it is your duty to implement them. Thank you, and god bless Novosibirsk and Altay."\n\nThroughout the next weeks, the Security Service got to work. Hundreds - if not thousands - were arrested, sometimes due to blatantly clear socialist connections and others due to mere rumors. In the dark alleys of the biggest cities, as well as in the mountainous countryside fit for resistance cells, many were caught, occasionally even after being ratted from civilians. However, inside the government and the agencies, there was still the sense that this was the beginning of something bigger, a general campaign against this terror, to root out the Narodniks once and for all."

Every time I see you it seems as if decades have passed. You seem to have lost the old fire you once had," Amet's eyes radiated worry for his old friend. Alexander took a long moment to collect his thoughts before he spoke.\n\n"If I may be honest with you, Amet, I am tired. The realities of the Federation's position have drained me as sure as anything. Amet, I know you do not approve of all of my actions. Of the state we have built. But I know that you understand why it had to be done. The bickering and the backroom deals, this is not a world for foolish idealists Amet. The failures of the old Union are all around us, and the failures of the Republic were what forced our hand. The people of Russia need a strong nation, led by strong men, not pointless words. You have to understand that," Pokryshkin's voice rose as he spoke.\n\n"I am sorry, Alexander. But I cannot agree. The people are the most important part of this Federation. Not the soldiers and the oligarchs. They deserve better than to be tread upon by the boots of the army and Corporate security," Amet could not help but feel that he had wasted his breath. That nothing he could say would ever change his course.\n\nAlexander looked prepared to continue the argument, and he likely would have escalated it as well, but before he could Amet out a hand on his shoulder.

Deals that could, Pokryshkin knew, not only have a tremendous impact on the Federations economic future, but also on the lives of the hundreds of thousands of workers within it. He very much wanted to close these deals.\n\nBut he also knew, keenly, that they would not come without cost. The men across from him were, to a one, sharks beyond measure in their field. A field in which he held little experience. They would not agree to anything that would benefit him or the Federation without ensuring that it would, to a greater extent, benefit them.\n\nPokryshkin was prepared to accept that. The Federation needed these men, and the organizations that they represented. It needed their factories, it needed their capital, it needed their employment and, above all, it needed their support. They could cause no end of trouble for him and his government if they opposed it, in any form.\n\nAnd, so, he flashed them a wide smile, and began to speak."

As he walked, he could not help but reminisce. His first mission with the Narodniks had been a resounding success. The plant had been destroyed and the weapon schematics had been vital to the continued success of the movement. From there, Siniy had participated in countless operations against Federation forces and the corporations they served. Magnates and politicians had fallen by his hands, entire Federation supply convoys had been hijacked and diverted, and in one particularly memorable mission he had destroyed an entire Titan manufacturing plant with little more than a pipe bomb and a well placed bottle of American soda.\n\nFinally, he entered the command center. Every surface was covered in maps, mission briefings, and reports. At the center of this controlled chaos was the leader of the movement, Comrade Chernyy. Chernyy was an old, grizzled veteran of the Great Patriotic War.\n\n"Welcome back, Comrade Siniy. I hope you are well rested. It has come time to go forward with our decapitation strike. The bastard Pokryshkin will be attending the demonstration of some new kind of fighter plane. It will be your duty to kill the bastard." Siniy was in shock.

"You see, back when I was in the army, things were not so bright in these lands. The old republic was fighting a seemingly endless war against Yagoda's hawks, but it was failing and I felt like I had to do something about it. That was when I met President Pokryshkin, who was one of the few to look at the situation not through an overly idealistic lens." He was interrupted by someone asking if he had really met the President, but he shrugged it off as nothing too important. "He was planning to bring peace to Novosibirsk and Altay, and I decided to join him in the endeavour. As you know, he succeeded, and here we are."\n\n"Mr. Suvorov, is it true you fought off a communist tank on your own?"\n\n"That is a real story, yes..." he replied chuckling. "We had been in the forests up north when we were attacked by a tank unit. I was away from my platoon, but I was quick enough to grab an old anti-tank weapon and fire it. Unfortunately, others were not so lucky - one of my friends died trying to distract an invading unit." There was silence for a moment. "But the mission was still successful.

Things weren't perfect, of course, the terrorists plaguing his lands were proof of that, but nevertheless, life was tolerable.\n\nHe pushed the stick forward, a smile filling his weathered face as he dived down.

Always a AA gun from Tomsk or Kemerovo, always a Kazakh raiding party that had strayed too far, always a foe that needed combating - but today was not one of those days.

But, no matter what they did, they could not get ahead.

Because the land was now theirs.\n\nThe program intended to address the refugee 'problem' by settling them on vast tracts of untilled land, removing them from the overpopulated communities while, hopefully, acting to increase agricultural output.

As he used his soot-blackened hands to load chunks of stone into the nearby cart, another thought occurred.\n\nWas the dawn so far away? Indeed, the Narodniks had failed in their mission, but so too had the state expended a great deal of time and resources putting them down. The Siloviks were raw, vulnerable. Suddenly, Kostin grinned, white teeth flashing brightly in the darkness. The iron was hot, the workers furious. Perhaps a second revolt would be what was needed to bring the whole structure crashing down."

Terrible security hazard for the president of the federation to be in public, for something as mundane as a meeting. Yet Seva also knew that in Novosibirsk, a little display of trust often went a long way. The soldier looked toward the reinforced limousine behind him. His boss was no doubt thinking about the meeting ahead. Or thinking about the other meetings of the day. Or not thinking at all, daydreaming about whatever it was that the Siberian Falcon occupied his mind with. Seva knew he couldn't keep up with his boss. That was why the boss was, well, the boss.\n\nAnother dark limousine. A lone man came out around the car, hands empty. Seva stepped forward, his hands away from his own weapon. "Mr. Chernyshevsky?" he asked?\n\nThe man shook his head. Opened the door to reveal his own boss, a short stocky type. Seva recognized the man, a former military intelligence analyst. Behind Seva, the door opened. President Pokryshkin emerged from his vehicle. Any tension from the meeting evaporated as the bodyguard stepped aside and the two powerful men shook hands and exchanged formalities. Seva soon found himself holding a crate of documents. Chernyshevsky's bodyguard held a manilla folder. What was in it? Pokryshkin often gave money or financial insider news in such courtesy calls. Chernyshevsky was an up and coming silovik, a man with a growing network of his own. It was good business to pay respect to men of his caliber.\n\nThe conversation over, Chernyshevsky disappeared into his car and drove away at high speed. Seva took note of the riflemen on the roof relaxing their stance. It paid to be prepared for anything, when one worked in the business of presidential security. The bodyguard sat in the back of Pokryshkin's car, finally allowing himself a moment of rest. His boss looked in a particularly jovial mood. Leafing through the intelligence report, the president smiled contentedly. "It seems that old man Pasternak is on the move again."\n\n"War, boss?" Seva asked. Pokryshkin shook his head.

Luka suddenly surged forwards, Kalashnikov held at the ready. The concrete tunnels were tight and difficult to fight in, but the breaching blast the SB men had discharged had stunned the Narodniks for the crucial moment needed to take them by surprise.\n\nLuka's gun chattered in the distinctive Kalashnikov language, spitting death at shaken communists. Bullets flew back at Luka and his team, and a round grazed his shoulder, already wounded once by the Narodniks in Altay. Luka ignored the pain, and he and the SB assault team began to clear the bunker, room by room, tunnel by tunnel. It was hard, grueling work, and by the time they had reached the final stretch of corridor, ten of the assault force were dead.\n\nFinally, Luka and the assault troopers stood before the command center door. It was, predictably, reinforced steel, and the demolitions team had already begun to set up a charge. Luka took the opportunity to catch his breath. Around him, the other SB men did the same, sucking in the stale, dusty air of the bunker. After a moment, the rest was over, and the charges detonated. This time, Luka ignored his frazzled senses and rushed inside, shouting for the occupants to surrender.\n\n"Fuck! Fuck!" shouted a man covered in pasty white dust, blood trickling from his nose.

Perhaps depression was the better word, from all the changes that surrounded Pushkin's world.\n\nThe first was seeing his second home, the Humanist headquarters, tapped off by soldiers, denying him and his comrades entrance into the building. "Your organization," said the officer in charge, "has been outlawed. Disperse, before you are dealt with." They did, and the sudden horror dawned on him there of how bad things were going to get.\n\nThe second was much less concrete, but just as real. The morale of the people of Tomsk had been destroyed, sucked up and spat out. Friends, who weeks prior had waved and shared wonderful memories together, barely looked at each other, let alone spoke. The park, once so filled with wandering, smiling faces, had been replaced by soldiers armed to the teeth.\n\nIt was as if all hope, all idealism, had been bleed from them, just as their men had been bleed on the battlefield.\n\nPushkin sighed.

It seemed, to Kamov's horrified eyes, that the whole experiment had failed.\n\nAnd the experiment's subjects, the people of Central Siberia, had undergone a change that Kamov, as a scientist, found shocking. Almost over night, the people and their optimism, once so filled with hope and joy, had shriveled up into a rotting husk. And that new atmosphere, the atmosphere of some corporate overlord, had expanded to the research division that Kamov worked in.\n\nAlthough the designs remained the same, the people changed. No longer was radical experimentation allowed. Now, it was all about 'efficiency' and 'results'. No longer would the halls of science be filled with creativity, intrigue, learning, and breakthroughs. Now it was going to be about how to make something easier to manufacture, easier to transport, and easier to make in bulk.\n\nKamov's helicopter was just one victim.

Already, he had to deal with the reality that he had no legitimacy. These people did not choose him, an outsider. Sokolov, no matter his personal beliefs, was a member of the Federation government, a distant, unknowable collection of bureaucrats and politicians who knew nothing about them. This Sokolov resented, if only because he had been briefed a significant amount by Zavoloko, who, in his wisdom, thought it would be important for Sokolov to understand the needs of the people. Apparently, Sokolov thought with bitterness, some didn't think that was enough.\n\nHe sighed. Perhaps he was being too negative. He had, over the course of the last couple weeks, been successful in removing most of the incompotent administrators under Zavoloko, who, by and large, were preachers, and not bureaucrats. At the very least it would show that Sokolov was trying to make an effort.

Soon, as the troops began pouring in, and the compounds and safe houses were raided, the members of the underground Black Army began to dissipate.

Sure, maybe they've been a little too heavy handed, but, hey, I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of my freedom for the sake of a better future.\n\nThe second, and the one I find the most offensive, is that our Federation is destined for failure, that we're too weak to get anything done. That is not only wrong, it is offensive, to the leaders and generals of this country, who have sacrificed countless man hours just to keep you and I safe from the hoards that lay behind our borders. We have a strong economy, strong leaders, and strong soldiers, who are going to be made even stronger by the first two.\n\nAnd the Federation will be made even stronger as the years go by, as economic development increases continually. According to some analysts, we may even become stronger than Germany when taking into account reunification and economic development.\n\nNow, to my fellow patriots, I leave you with a good little song that some of you may remember. It's a little different from how you remember it, but, hey, it may be better for you that way!"

 PAV_expansion.15.desc:0 "Pokryshkin sat at his desk, looking out onto the streets. It was bright, but not bright enough to block out the shining of the stars overhead. Looking towards them made him remember his childhood, and the horrible poverty he had experienced. Of course, that seemed so much more quaint than the poverty of some after the collapse, but it was still painful.\n\nHe had crawled to the top of the air force, crawled from that slum and from those criminals and hoodlums to become one of the most famous airmen in Russia. And yet, it did nothing. The Germans came marching still, like the Huns of the West, crushing and butchering everything in their paths. He could still remember flying above a town, burnt to the ground, smoke filling the sky. All he could imagine then were the screams, and the flaying bodies.\n\nAnd now, he was the leader of a nation, a nation whose principles seemed so in line with his own. Liberation, freedom, decentralization. Far from the centralized nightmare that was the Soviet Union. And yet, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get it to work. The pieces wouldn't fit. He couldn't fit the square peg into the round hole.\n\nAnd so he compromised. A stronger office here, a stronger government there, until he realized that the ball of centralization kept going further and further. And now those principles, those principles he sacrificed so much for, had been ripped up.\n\nAnd, the worst part about it, was that he felt nothing. Pokryshkin felt like he should feel something, some sadness at the death of utopianism he had. But he didn't. The compromises, in his eyes, worked. Without them, he wouldn't be where he was. Without them, his people wouldn't be anywhere near as good as they are now.\n\nPerhaps, Pokryshkin thought, the principles of the Federation would be revived. Perhaps the government would give their constituent parts more say in their affairs, more trust in the people. But he doubted that. And so, he looked out the window, just as he did as a young man."

Barnaul was not nearly as important as the great city itself, of course, but it was important enough, and he was important enough within it, to be able to take some form of action.\n\nAnd that action had worked. He had been able, if only for a short while, to delay several measures focused on further increasing that degree of centralization. He knew he should have felt joy, or at least satisfaction, at such success. And yet, he did not, for he knew that though he had slowed the process, he had not, and would not be able to, halt it for very long.\n\nHis influence and popularity would allow him to do so for a while longer, but as he regarded the reports, all he could think about was how much time he had won.\n\nAnd how he knew it would not be much."

It hadn't been like that when he had simply been the mayor or Barnaul, but with his elevated position, so many things had changed. He had tired, of course, and it wasn't like he enjoyed working until the AM, but it was something that the man felt as if he had to do.\n\nShukshin's place in the administration of the Federation had placed him front and center in what passed for political machinations of the polity, resulting in his less-than-cynical ideas being the natural foil for his political counterpart, Pokryshkin. But as the documents bled together, the words and letters became increasingly incomprehensible in Shukshin's brain, out of the fog that permeated his mind came the deep worries that only ever emerged on the latest of nights.\n\nHis mind went to the origins of the federation, and how it was originally based on freedom and liberty, but how the necessity of the federation's system had resulted in an erosion of the federation's basic principles, revealing corruption, apathy, and cynicism - unfortunately embodied by many of his political peers. He felt conflicted about his role in the state, and how it would, or wouldn't play out. He had once been a genuine democrat, convinced of the federation's noble methods. But as the situation degraded, Shukshin could do nothing but wonder if his support of Pokryshkin and the federation in general had been worth it. After no small deliberation, Shukshin spoke to himself, quietly, as if he wanted no one to hear despite the utter absence of company in his lonely office.\n\n"I remember the struggle against tyranny. I'll hold on to that memory, and do my best to do it justice.""

Dozens of well-placed shots from those behind the machine preventing any sort of reaction.\n\nWith a loud crash and a hailstorm of scattered debris, the armored vehicle smashed through the barricade, soon followed by the men of the All-Siberian Army. Rifles and machine guns spat fire in all directions, scattering those who remained. A ballad of chaos and death, a routine that Corporal Ivanov was all too familiar with. Several dozen bodies already marked the dust and rubble, almost certain to be joined by more as the rebels fled in disarray.\n\nFor all their talk, factory workers and technicians were no match for professional soldiers, and this fragment of Kostin's naive rebellion was no different."

He had always been of little relevance. His message had always been able to be contained. That was no longer the case.\n\nUnder the silovik-dominated central government, there were always going to be many people who lost out. Who did not reap the massive rewards that their betters did. And, while they may not have individual power, there were a lot of them. They were now, along with others, were now turning out to Shukshin's public rallies.

Central Siberia now rightly belongs to us, and with Siberia comes her vast resources. Until now, we have lacked the infrastructure and heavy machinery to exploit them, but this has changed." Langemak paused for a moment, allowing himself a breath and for the information to sink into the brains of those assembled.\n\n"With our hold over Central Siberia secured, we can now begin to collect what Mother Russia has seen fit to bless us with. Myself and President Pokryshkin have discussed at length a plan to see us all enriched, both the state and the corporations." Swallowing, Langemak added, "Mr.President, I yield the floor to you."\n\n"Thank you, minister of economics," began Pokryshkin, "Siberia is laden with petrol, natural gas, gold, diamonds, iron and coal. Billions, if not trillions, of rubles worth of resources lie beneath the earth. I do not wish to mince words, so here is my proposal: We, the government, will subsidize all mining and extraction operations in exchange for a percentage of the materials to be negotiated on an individual basis. Together, we will transform the Federation from just another warlord state into an economic juggernaut and profit in the process.

The sergeant clanged a bell so loud it hurt Fyodor's ears. "Move it, worms! You worthless sacks of shit aren't worthy of being in my beloved army! To the field! Now!" Fyodor's old sergeant in Tomsk wasn't nearly as boisterous, preferring rousing speeches about the defense of democracy against the hordes of the wasteland. This army was different. This army knew it was the big dog in Siberia, and woe betide any who claimed otherwise. Offensive war versus defensive war, supposed Fyodor.\n\nThe men ran, performed live-fire drills, and sparred, all the while enduring the relentless abuse of the sergeant. Despite his former service in the army of Tomsk, Fyodor could have sworn the boot camp he was put through in that former nation was far less strenuous. In this new army, his body was hardened just as his mind was broken and reshaped into a soldier of the Federation.\n\nAs he lay exhausted in his cot that night, brain barely able to form coherent thoughts from the constant fatigue, he briefly pondered the irony that had led him here. Once a defender of democracy, Fyodor was now in service to... well, a slightly different form of democracy. He supposed he could live with that."

Prisoners of war that held officer rank within their now defunct militaries are requesting that we release them from prison and grant them commissions. Ordinarily, I wouldn't hesitate to refuse such a request, but I have seen it fit to pass their desires up to your office. The return of prisoners of war becomes a difficult proposition when the country they were captured form no longer exists. Additionally, these officers, including some of senior rank, could provide invaluable military expertise to our own armed forces.\n\nI have my own personal concerns with this request, as the pardoning of those responsible for waging war against our nation sets a dangerous standard. What we don't need is Narodniks claiming legal precedent for their own pardons. Naturally, the choice is yours, and I will be awaiting your reply.\n\nSigned,\n\nDmitry Glinka, Minister of Defense."

As you know-"\n\n"Yes yes, the backbones of our weapons and agricultural industries. I'm fully aware of what these corporations do around here."\n\n"Al-Alright... Well then. The two corporations both desire different trading partners. Feniks supports diplomacy with the OFN and America. The United States has cutting edge technology and has no reason to fear that their supplies might be used against them They don't believe the Japanese would be nearly as willing to negotiate arms deals. Meanwhile, Sibir wants to trade primarily with the Sphere. They believe the Sphere can provide unique opportunities that America can simply never provide. This wouldn't be such a problem for our economy, if the two corporations weren't trying so hard to sway us to their side. They're bribing every politician they can get their hands on, and there are even some allegations that the two corporations are trying to sabotage each other. If this matter isn't resolved-"\n\n"Their stocks could fall, and bring our economy down with them," Pokryshkin could do nothing more than sigh.

And, yet, that was exactly what was happening.\n\nPresident Pokryshkin had arrived earlier in the day, and as he and his entourage approached the Prime Minister, their thoughts returned to the many explanations their advisors had given them for this extraordinary meeting. Pokryshkin's state was growing rapidly - in economic power, physical size, and military capability - and could, in short order, pose a threat to the interests of the Sphere.\n\nThat is, if it were allowed to forge close relationships with other states without also doing so with Japan itself. In addition, a number of Japanese industrial concerns had voiced the potential benefits of future business relationships with the growing state, and such could not be ignored. Thus, relations had been steadily increasing, and were to be cemented here today.\n\nArriving in front of the Prime Minister, Pokryshkin offered a slight bow, which was immediately returned, and both smiled for the many cameras watching.

Operating conditions within his factory, in terms of both safety and workload, had improved, and he found himself, at the end of the day, still possessing considerable energy. With the chance to relax. This was most unusual.\n\nIt also led to Grigory asking many questions. Why was this the case? Was the Federation's government truly committed to the reform that he had heard promised, and originally dismissed as yet another empty pledge? Were they temporary measures, intended only to placate the thousands upon thousands of workers who had risen in the Great Revolt? And, if so, how long would they last?\n\nFor a long while Grigory debated these questions within himself, until he realized, at long last, that the answer did not matter. Or that, if it did, it certainly didn't matter to him. No matter what it truly was, his workday had, quite simply, gotten both easier and safer.\n\nAnd that was good enough for him."

They had formed into fine soldiers for whom producing criticism was difficult, but more importantly, a strong sense of camaraderie had formed among them, and where once they seemed close to apathetic about their roles within the military of the Federation, now they helped each other fulfill their respective eagerness with a sort of eagerness that Margelov hadn't seen in a long, long time. Given time, they stood a real chance of becoming the best soldiers Margelov had ever had the pleasure of working with.\n\nFor now, however, there was still work to be done, and so he returned to instruct them, trying to wipe the proud smile off his face and only partially succeeding.

Everything must have a purpose, a use to society, and pointless ceremonies like that did not.\n\nIt was ironic, Kabiskoy thought, that someone like him now governed what was once the last bastion of the old Central Siberian Republic, a realist in a city of idealists. Not that they would remain idealistic for long if he had any say in it, which he most certainly did. The clashing ideologies, the salons, the precious 'liberty' of the old Republic had been its greatest weaknesses,with the collapse being the inevitable result. The Federation had been founded on not repeating that mistake, and with his election as mayor, Kabiskoy would do everything in his power to make sure that it never would.

Deciding to make the best of it, Voznesensky had joined forces with Shukshin, and stood as the candidate of liberty in the latest Tomsk mayoral elections, ultimately proving triumphant through his ideals. Now, he would govern one of the most important cities of the Federation and aid Shukshin's cause further, in order to return to this great city a semblance of the freedom it had once enjoyed.\n\nEven as he waved to the crowd as he walked up the steps of the stage from which he would be inaugurated and then give his victory speech, he knew that this would be no easy task to accomplish.

Those protestors on the rightward edges of the spectrum argued and clashed with those on the left. Both despised the 'weakness' of those in the center. And those in the center reciprocated, refusing to pander to 'extremists' of any fashion.\n\nThe police had naturally been called out, and it had been the original intention of the government to disperse the protest. Violently if need be. But as the hours continued it became clear that such would not be needed. Arguments among the protestors turned into fistfights, and before long the protest collapsed entirely, dispersing soon after. Some of the most hardened protestors had to be arrested, of course, but it had overall been a victory won without much engagement.\n\nAnd many in the government hoped it was a sign of the increasing irrelevance of opposition in general."

The men were dressed in the finest suits and smoked the finest imported cigars. A man from Sibir spoke up, "It seems clear to me that we should open up closer ties to the Japanese. We can leverage the influence of the Zaibatsu and increase our own influence in the Japanese markets."\n\n"Are you serious? The Japanese markets are dominated by the Zaibatsu, we would be operating at a loss for years. It's too risky. We would be much better off breaking into the American markets," an executive from Feniks insisted.\n\n"Perhaps we might look to the former Triumvirate? The economic chaos they have recently experienced could be the perfect time for us to strike. These are truly untapped markets that are hungry for new investments," yet another Feniks' man put forward.\n\n"All of you seem to be ignoring a large source of potential profit. The Reich may have been ravaged by its civil war, but it is still a very rich market," as the man from Sibir stopped speaking, the boardroom fell completely silent. All around the table the other executives looked at him with aghast expressions.\n\n"Are you insane!? The Germans? Those bastards would sooner kill us all than do business with us. What kind of bullshit have you Sibir boys been drinking? The Reich is off the table. Period." After that the boardroom descended into raised voices just short of shouting. Board Members wagged their cigars at each other and hurled insults.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, tensions had reached their highest point and only the break for lunch had prevented the room from descending into complete chaos."

 PAV_superregional.1.t:0 "A Den of Radicals"
 PAV_superregional.1.desc:0 "Pokryshkin tossed the report onto his desk in disgust. It was a general overview on the situation in far eastern Siberia, and reading through it had dashed all traces of optimism he had felt about the region. It wasn't all bad, to be fair. Controlling the port town of Magadan finally gave them access to the sea, and with a little investment Irkutsk could become a major economic and industrial hub. But aside from a few scattered bright spots like those the report was nothing but bad news. The far east had always been difficult to administer, even for a united Russian nation. Now he had to attempt the same task with far less resources than the Empire or the Union had been able to field. And on top of everything else, there was the main topic of the report: Partisans.\n\nBased on early reports alone Pokryshkin's security experts were telling him there were no less than eight organized radical terrorist organizations operating in the far east, and possibly as many as a dozen. They came in all stripes. Fascists, communists, monarchists, anarchists, zealots, Cossacks, separatists, and more besides. The only reason they hadn't already collapsed the entire east into partisan warfare was because they spent as much time fighting each other as the central government. The report warned that might not be the case forever. The longer they are allowed to exist, the more likely it is that like-minded groups will form a common front against the newly formed Russian Federation. This cannot be allowed to happen.\n\nPokryshkin picked up the phone and started dialing the number. If consolidating central Siberia had taught him anything, it was that there was only one way to deal with radicals. They were so wrapped up in their own meaningless theories and ideologies they barely even lived in the real world, and that made them too dangerous to tolerate. They would be dragged out of their holes and brought into the light where the people of Russia could see them for what they were: not brave partisans, but desperate terrorists with no place in the new Russia."

 PAV_superregional.2.desc:0 "The truck rolled down the dirt road through the forest, jostling the men inside. A few smoked in silence, filling the back of the truck with the smell of cigarettes. Some slept, their snores inaudible over the rumbling engine. Feodor was seated at the rear of the truck, staring out of the window, while next to him Lev continued to jabber incessantly.\n\n"Hey Feodor, how do you know when you've killed a communist?"\n\n"I don't know Lev, how?" Feodor said.\n\n"When he starts to bleed out, he calls his own blood reactionary and tells it to read more theory!" Lev laughed at his own joke, though Feodor was unamused. Seeing this, Lev tried again.\n\n"How do you know when you've killed a fascist?"\n\nFeodor glared at him\n\n"When he starts to bleed out, he calls you a Jew bastard and says his blood is too strong to leave his body!"\n\nOnce more Lev cackled at his own lack of wit, and once more Feodor remained silent. When Lev finished laughing Feodor spoke.\n\n"Have you ever killed anyone Lev?"\n\nLev looked at him, confused. "Maybe, I've fired my gun in combat a lot but I'm not sure."\n\n"Well, have you ever watched anyone bleed out?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Well I have. I've watched five men die. A communist, two anarchists, a fascist, and a Cossack. None of them talked about race or theory while they were dying.""

 PAV_superregional.3.t:0 "Shoot and Smash"
 PAV_superregional.3.desc:0 "They struck at midnight. The raid preceded by the blinding light of flares scattered around the building as the soldiers sprang the trap. Machine guns sprayed death barely feet off the ground as the infantry sprang into action, pushing towards the structure in a text-book assault. Ducking into cover just before a dozen slugs which tore through the space that he had formerly occupied, the air went out of his chest. He took a few deep breaths and blinked his eyes once, twice, three times. Good enough. Firing a few bullets at the general direction of the structure, the Sargeant rolled left to join the rest of his unit, already going through the motions of the battle drill.\n\nThe screaming, shooting, and dying lasted all of five minutes before the white handkerchiefs went up, and the black-shirted figures stepped out in surrender, bodies surrounding the once picturesque cabin. As he counted losses, and took in sight, Ivanov gave the sorry looking Blackshirts a glare of contempt, for all their enthusiasm for violence, he had seen Anarchists handle themselves better than these jackbooted thugs."

 PAV_superregional.4.t:0 "The Last Gasp"
 PAV_superregional.4.desc:0 "Captain Ivan Brantov led his men through the streets of Irkutsk in the dead of night. His men moved as a well-oiled machine through the darkness. They were deep in the industrial district of Irkutsk, closing in on the worker's housing that dotted the outskirts of the factories. Their mission was a simple one, to root out elements of Yagoda's NKVD that had survived the strife in the Far-East.\n\nAs they approached their target, he motioned for his men to split into two teams. His team would breach the front of the enemy structure, an abandoned apartment complex. The second team, under the command of Lieutenant Ugolev, would be tasked with breaching the rear entry and preventing the enemy from making a retreat. Ivan approached the doorway into the building unmolested and had his men stack up on the doors. His men entered the building and were met with an eerie silence. The men went about securing the first floor and found nothing, there was no sign this floor had been inhabited in years.\n\nIvan left three men behind in the lobby to act as a rearguard and pressed forward towards the stairwell. This would be the most dangerous part of the operation, traversing the stairwell into the second and third floors. He crept up the stairs slowly, keeping watch for any sort of traps. It was as he ascended the last step that he heard the gunfire from the base of the stairs. They had used the elevator shaft to get behind them.\n\nIvan began to shout out orders but was cut off as he had to dive for cover as soldiers on the second floor opened fire. He was only able to take rare potshots at his assailants. He was able to drop one before being hit in the shoulder. His rifle clattered from his grasp and fell down the stairwell. He cursed and drew his sidearm, only to be perforated by fire from a man on the stairs above him.\n\nIvan's body tumbled onto his men below. Before the NKVD could celebrate, the rear team made their appearance. The communists were defeated, but it was a pyrrhic victory at best."

 PAV_superregional.5.t:0 "Partisan Activity Decreases"
 PAV_superregional.5.desc:0 "It has been reported, to the central government, that the efforts of the national anti-partisan task force have continued to show considerable effect.\n\nAcross the territories in which they have been deployed, executed operations, against remnants of both the RFP as well as various communist organs, have proven highly successful, with only several reported failures. Large numbers of insurgents and dissidents have been captured or killed, enormous quantities of material have been captured, and insurgent leadership has been greatly compromised.\n\nConcurrently, elements of state government have returned to, or been established in, areas declared secured from partisan influence. This has not only returned life to normal for millions of our citizens, but greatly strengthened our control of, and extraction from, the regions in question.\n\nHowever, we must take care to not grow complacent. Though activity has, through vigorous and sometimes bloody action, decreased, fanatical elements do remain, and they are still to be considered extremely dangerous.\n\nWe must stay the course. Until our lands are secured - and purged of partisan elements - for good."

 PAV_superregional.6.t:0 "A Future in the Commissariat"
 PAV_superregional.6.desc:0 "Life had never been easy for Ruslan or his family. Not under the communists, not under the fascists and not, so far at least, under the new regime of the Federation.\n\nThey had always been poor in the extreme, and Ruslan had watched as his father, his uncle, and his older brother worked themselves into the ground trying to keep their farm working. He had thought that to be his eventual fate as well, but then, accompanying his father into the village to sell their produce, he had seen the poster.\n\nMen were needed, it said, to fill out the many new commissariats the Federation had established throughout the Far East. To help distribute supplies, provide order and, of course, secure the land for the state. It also offered pay. Pay far in excess of what Ruslan could earn selling vegetables. And, so, after seeing his father to market he had walked towards the enlistment booth set up in the square.\n\nHis father had not been happy, but he had, in the end, understood. Ruslan was trying to secure a better future for himself, and the man could not begrudge his son that, allowing him to depart with his blessing.\n\nRuslan could only hope that he was successful."

 PAV_superregional.7.t:0 "Port of Profit"
 PAV_superregional.7.desc:0 "Having received significant investment into its development under the rule of the Federation, the seaside city of Magadan has transformed from a backwater second-rate harbor braved only by the most daring of sailors, into a truly international port welcoming to all, but especially those with money in their pockets. Every day, ships from all around the Pacific carrying sailors and traders from all around the world stop at the docks, loading or unloading cargo into or out of their storages, with hired help always available from the people of Magadan if they need it.\n\nThis success in its function as a port has made Magadan a key part of the Federal economy, bringing great wealth into Siberia and enriching all involved in the industry. At the same time, the promise of riches and greatness has attracted many from across the Federation to the city, making Magadan grow and even blossom. The addition of a new significant port to those already existing along the Pacific has also caused an increase of trade in the region, benefiting the partners of the Federation as well."

 PAV_superregional.8.t:0 "Commissarial Training"
 PAV_superregional.8.desc:0 "A long, hard life of farming would certainly have prepared Ruslan for the hardships of military training. Or so he had thought. The reality was very different indeed.\n\nThe man at the enlistment station had been all smiles. His boot camp instructor was all frowns. Along with shouting and anger besides. He woke every morning in the pitch dark, marched until he was exhausted, instructed and then tested on the lessons afterwards, shoveled as much food down as possible, and then fell into an exhausted sleep. Only to repeat the process the next day.\n\nDespite the hardship, however, Ruslan could not say that he hated the experience. He was learning skills, both military and organizational, and was making many friends besides. Friends from all over the region, from areas he had only ever heard of in passing, and they were fascinating.\n\nHe could not wait until he completed training, and got a chance to see the lands of whatever region he was assigned to. He knew, now, that this was to be his destiny. His career.\n\nThe better future he had hoped for."

 PAV_superregional.9.t:0 "The Almighty Airborne"
 PAV_superregional.9.desc:0 "Observing as his men went about their interminable duties, General Vasily Margelov knew that, if nothing else, he had at least made his soldiers ready for what was to come. The Federation was strong, but these men were stronger. The Federation stood ready to at last reunite the motherland by any means necessary, and these men would lead the charge in any further conflict towards that goal. They had truly become a unit he could be proud of, as a father is of his children.\n\nOne of them walked up to him, delivering a perfectly crisp salute before beginning to deliver a scheduled report. Margelov could barely make out the words, however, too lost in his own thoughts. As confident as he was in their ability, only more hardship awaited them now as they began to move west. He was confident that they were ready, of course. The question was, would being ready be enough? There was no way of knowing if even the best of Russia's soldiers could win the wars to come, and more importantly, which of them would make it back alive.\n\nAs the man before him finished his report, Margelov nodded and sent him off, to be alone with his thoughts and anxieties."

 PAV_superregional.10.t:0 "Freedom's Champion"
 PAV_superregional.10.desc:0 "The 2nd President of the Siberian Federation turned towards his rapt audience, the thousands eagerly awaiting the first words of his Inaugural Address. He didn't have a prepared speech per-se; he couldn't fix the country's many problems with a professional speechwriter. No, this was to the start of a new kind of administration.\n\nThe people had suffered enough, first from Bukharin's authoritarianism and mismanagement, and then from the CSR and their misguided idealism who had gotten so many killed in their failed wars. Finally, Pokryshkin and his corporate backers, who in their endless pursuit of stability and wealth, had forgotten the average Russian.\n\nThere would be no more of that, not on his watch. Some may have sympathized with his cause - Sibir, and their backers - but Feniks, Titan, and the rest of them were venal, corrupt, heartless, ruled by a hundred would-be dictators. To hell with them. The supremacy of the corporations, the rise of the Siloviki, the bastardization of the Federation's ideals, those had been the final straws, the acts which made good people stand up and retake their destiny.\n\nAnd so he spoke. "Fellow citizens, I have not come to begin a revolution. I have come to fulfill the ideals of which we have not forgotten!"\n\nThe crowd cheered wildly.\n\nHe smiled, basking in the love of his fellow citizens. It would be a long, hard road, but President Shukshin knew he could make things right again."

 PAV_superregional.11.t:0 "In the Office"
 PAV_superregional.11.desc:0 "For what seemed like the hundredth time that day, Vasily Shukshin looked over the legislation crowding the Presidents-no, his desk. It was still hard to believe that the Presidency, for so long the preview of Pokryshkin and his ilk, was now in the hands of a peasant from Atlay, but he was here, and it was his.\n\nPicking up one of the many pages on his desk Shukshin looked over it once more, slowly flipping through its contents. Workers protections, new regulations encompassing lobbying, and other vectors of corporate influence, stringent antitrust laws. It wouldn't be enough to defang the corporations, not by a long shot. Their influence reached far too deep for a mere piece of legislation to reverse the impact of a decade of unfettered exploitation, but it was a start.\n\nThe corporate giants, and Pokryhkin's clique, would fight them every step of the way. Their lackeys in the Duma, and the Siloviki who had long been paid off with corporate gold. Shukshin, however, had the will of the people-and the power of the Presidency-on his side."

 PAV_superregional.12.t:0 "A Writer and a Falcon"
 PAV_superregional.12.desc:0 "It was early in the morning when the two men met in one of the many rooms of the Presidential palace, flames flickering in the fireplace, snowmelt falling from the frost-covered roof. The new and former President of the Siberian Federation glancing at each other uneasily. They had been friends once, comrades in arms during the final days of the Republic. Those days were gone, a friendship strained and broken amidst the rise of the Federation.\n\n"Where did it all go wrong Vasily? Where did we lose our way." Shukshin glanced up at Pokryshkin's voice, the Falcon of Siberia staring down into his drink. There was no malice in eyes, no resentment, just a colorless pallor, and a resigned expression.\n\nShukshin stared at his own drink, for he had no response. No answer to the question that he himself had pondered on many a sleepless night. He could still faintly remember the optimism in the Federation's early days, the final break from the decaying Republic amidst the chaos of the Siberian War and Anarchist revolt. A time where the Federation seemed to have a place for everybody, regardless of ideology or wealth. Before the corruption and cynicism set in, before the rise of the Siloviki and the Corporations.\n\nHe could point to many a time where he or Pokryshkin should've stepped in, should've moved to reign in the excesses of the system. But, the Federation itself was a reaction, a result of the failed idealism of the poets and artists in Tomsk. Perhaps the cynicism which arose in idealism's place was simple yet another inevitable, another result of the Republic's failure.\n\nShukshin looked back up at his compatriot, the Falcon was waiting for an answer, and so he spoke the honest truth."

 PAV_superregional.13.t:0 "A Victory for the Silovik State"
 PAV_superregional.13.desc:0 "President Pokryshkin sat behind his desk with a sense of satisfaction. Shukshin and his colleagues had failed. He had been confirmed as the President of the Federation against all of his detractors. The President smiled as he sipped on an aged brandy from his private stock.\n\nThe election had been the death knell of the Federalist cause. Shukshin had been ousted from his position, with his good friend Mikhail Devyatayev taking up the position once occupied by the bleeding heart mayor. With another drink he thought of his next moves. He would have to ensure that the Federalists were completely shut out of power. They would need to be replaced by men loyal to the cause of the Federation, strong men who would provide stability for the state. A return to business as usual was essential, as now that he had been confirmed he would need to consolidate the power of the executive.\n\nLooking out over the city, Alexander took another sip and leaned back in his chair. The election had ensured that the legitimacy of the silovik system had been cemented in the public consciousness. Indeed, the failure of the federalists was the best thing that could have happened for his regime.\n\nAlexander raised his glass to the window and gave a small toast to himself and the Federation."
 PAV_superregional.13.a:0 "A toast to the strong."
 
 PAV_superregional.14.t:0 "New Opportunities"
 PAV_superregional.14.desc:0 "President Alexander Pokryshkin strode into the conference room exuding nothing but the utmost confidence in his position. Already seated were representatives of the big three corporations in the Federation. As he took his seat, he helped himself to the offered drink and practically ignored the other men at the table. When he was ready, he motioned for the men to begin the meeting. "Thank you for joining us, Mr. President. We understand how busy your schedule is and appreciate this meeting," a well groomed man from Sibir began. After the usual pleasantries were observed, business began in earnest.\n\n"Gentlemen, the Federation's recent acquisition of the Russian Far-East has opened up to us a whole new area for profit. What the region lacks in population it more than makes up for in the sheer bounty of natural resources," Pokryshkin began.\n\n"Indeed, the region has a vast potential for the expansion of our operations, and the profits therein. The question, I suppose, must be on the distribution of this vast material wealth. All of our companies have interest in the lands of the Far-East, after all." The Sibir man glared at the representative from Titan as he spoke. In order to head off any argument, the President spoke.\n\n"Gentlemen, as with all of our acquisitions, you shall have a say in the distribution of the land. So long as your financial departments can afford. I believe we shall first speak of the lands around the city of Irkutsk, as they are ripe for exploitation."\n\nThe meeting progressed as smoothly as previous meetings had, and by the end of it the President had made many profitable deals with the men, enough to ensure the economy of the Federation continued to flourish, at least."

 PAV_superregional.15.t:0 "Faded Ideals"
 PAV_superregional.15.desc:0 "President Alexander Pokryshkin sat at his desk late in the night. Frost creeped on the edges of his windows and a great fire roared in the fireplace. He leaned back in his chair after a long day, having only just finished the day's paperwork, and sipped a glass of wine. As he sat there, stewing in his own thoughts, his mind drifted back to better days. He remembered his days flying high in the air over the battle lines, fighting for the glory of Bukharin's Union. He remembered the pride he took in the ideals of the Union, the brotherhood of all its people, and the optimism that had consumed them all in those days.\n\nBefore he could get too invested in the nostalgia, however, he remembered the worst parts of those days. He could remember the despair of the Great Patriotic War, the fear and terror he felt as the Germans just kept pushing no matter what he did. The feelings of despair as he fought a desperate war in the air as his friends and countrymen died on the ground, knowing there was nothing he could that could turn the tide. Most of all he remembered the death of the Union's ideals when the Germans pushed to the AA Line and the union fell.\n\nThe ideals of those days could not last before the onslaught of the fascists. Even in the aftermath, when the Central Siberian Republic was whole and strong, it could not be said that the grand ideals of the past had succeeded. Yet, his ideals had not truly faded until the Federation began its march for a strong Russia.\n\nAlexander shook his head, dismissing the musings of the past. The old days were behind him and thoughts of a free Russia had been dismissed for good reason. What Russia needed was strength and stability at any cost. At his core he knew this to be true."

 PAV_superregional.16.t:0 "The Music of Machinery"
 PAV_superregional.16.desc:0 "President Alexander Pokryshkin looked upon Novosibirsk from his office and smiled. Before him was a city fit to be the capital of his new Russian Federation. Skyscrapers towered over the city, filled with the new ruling class of Russia: the Oligarchs, the overseers of his new Russia. This truly was the paradise for the Siloviks.\n\nHowever, as Alexander continued to stare from his office down below, he also saw those who benefited the least from his system. Ragged workers walked to and fro towards the factories on the outskirts of the city. Those unemployed could be seen laying about in the streets, begging for money only to be cleared out by the police and forced to go somewhere else other than the upper districts. Memories of Shukshin's cries for a fair and just Russia filled Alexander's mind, which only made him chuckle. That man was a shell, a broken man forced back to the bottle he hated so much for Shukshin and his posse had failed to realize one, singular truth about Russia.\n\nRussia was a harsh nation, and it needed to a strongman to bring it to progress and modernity.\n\nAnd Russia needed to be strong and stable for what was to come. The Germans still had their steely grip on Moscow and Russians suffered under them. They deserved to be a part of Russia, for they are true born Russians, not colonial subjects of a regime of a foreign nation. He would receive what belonged to the Federation back no matter what, no matter the cost.\n\nThe machine of Russia had been broken time and time again, but he had fixed the machine. Now, he orchestrated a symphony of machines, working together for his grand designs for his nation. He couldn't help but smile as he sat down once again in his chair, and toasted the victory to come."

 PAV_superregional.17.desc:0 "The rising sun illuminated the waters of the Ob with a brilliant glow, orange splotches dancing amidst its glimmering waters. They were cleaner now, thanks to new regulations, and he could see several families picnicking along the river's banks.\n\nShukshin allowed himself a small drink as he took in the sight, remembering his excursion to the waterfront nearly a decade ago. Unchecked corporate excess and institutional corruption, a government-run by and for local strongmen. He had changed all that; no longer did corporate greed dictate policy and law, no longer were the working class squeezed for every penny. There was still much to be done, of course, fairer regulations, the issue of Pokryshkin's clique, increased federalization, and the ever-pressing matter of hated Germans.\n\nYet, as he saw workers joking around in the fields just beyond the river and families enjoying a vacation for the first time in years, Shukshin felt something stir inside of him. The idealism which was once so infectious in the early days of the Central Siberian Republic. He was doing this for them, for the people, for Russia, all of Russia, not just those born into power, those blessed by circumstance. He remembered those days, the headiness and optimism, and how everything fell apart under the strain of the Siberian War, and the fighting against the Anarchists, the food riots, the shootings.\n\nHe poured himself another drink as the morning sun rose high in the sky. The CSR may have fallen under the strain of war, but the Federation-his Federation-was different, stronger, and more robust, yet no less concerned for the welfare of its citizens.\n\nIt was different than the CSR. It had to be."

For years our air force and those of the other warlords have been almost totally defensive in nature, more focused on beating back air raids than launching our own. This is finally beginning to change.\n\nEarly tests have shown that the M-50 is an extremely promising candidate as a next generation strategic bomber. Its four engines allow it to move at high speeds for an aircraft of its size and it is able to achieve extremely high altitudes, making it a difficult target for all but the heaviest anti-aircraft systems to hit. Even at high altitudes it is able to deliver its bomb load with extreme precision, comparable to the accuracy of the best bombers in the German air fleet. With the proper training and escorts, a squadron of these planes could rain hell on our enemies and escape without a scratch. When the time comes to reclaim the west from Germany, the M-50 will have what it takes to make the Germans regret thinking they could bomb us with impunity all those years ago."

Due to the bulk of the plane, additional engines had to be incorporated into the design to allow it to reach its target speed. The additional bulk of the engine reduced the plane's aerodynamic profile, making it less maneuverable and more vulnerable to interceptor aircraft. Additional issues with the bomb deployment mechanism made accurate targeting highly difficult.\n\nDespite the multitude of problems that have rendered the M-50 an unusable design, our engineers have managed to salvage some of the more innovative ideas incorporated into the prototype. The tests proved that the concept of high-altitude strategic bombing is both possible and achievable with an improved design, and with better engines it should be possible to produce a strategic bomber that is capable of achieving high speeds without issue.

In the end, after months of stress and work by dozens of engineers and designers, the project had spent almost twice its original budget before a prototype was completed and ready to fly. It would all be worth it as long as the test was successful.\n\nAs the bomber climbed into the sky the men collected in the control tower watched nervously. The pilot read off readings at predetermined intervals, rattling off his air speed, temperature inside the cabin, fuel burn rate, and more. Everything seemed to be going well. One engineer breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThe left wing started to visibly wobble. The pilot reported the plane was beginning to turn and shake outside of his control. The captain in the control tower grabbed the microphone and began to rattle off instructions when they all watched the wing tear off completely. The pilot ejected; a black speck held aloft by a white piece of canvas.

To offset this disadvantage, it is heavily armored, leading some of the test pilots to dub it the flying tank."

He hurriedly picked it up and said one word. "Sultan"\n\n"Mr Shukshin" Amat-Khan Sultan replied from the other end. "I apologize for the delay. I was trying to work something out at the last minute before I called." His tone was professional, but there was a hint of disappointment in his voice it couldn't fully cover.\n\n"I take it you didn't get anyone then." Shukshin sighed.\n\n"Worse, I got an influential army captain by the name of Pokroskov. He and several of his comrades were ready to endorse you but he made too much noise and was found out. He was discharged and replaced within the hour and now no one will even speak to me, not if it puts their careers on the line."\n\nShukshin couldn't hold back the long sigh that followed. "That's... disappointing. Thank you for your efforts Sultan, I know you did your best and things got out of hand."\n\n"I appreciate that, sir." Sultan replied. "I will keep trying and I am still willing to endorse you, but I'd advise your future campaign strategies not rely on any support from the military. Good night."\n\nThe line went dead. Shukshin put the phone back where it sat and rubbed his temples."

 PAV_elections.4.desc:0 "On a normal night, the Barnaul Theater would be hosting a local musician or an amateur dramatic company debuting a new production, and it would draw a decent audience of the residents of the city whose name the theater bore. But this was no normal night. The main event was not scheduled to start for two more hours and there were already lines around the block. As soon as the doors opened people excitedly filed in, taking any seat they could find. Within half an hour of opening its doors, the Barnaul had to close them again. For the first time in decades, every seat in the house was full. Even the standing room in the back was packed solid.\n\nThe excited chattering of the audience suddenly quieted as the lights winked, then dimmed, a sign that things were about to begin. From backstage Vasily Shukshin took one last deep breath, patted the speech in his pocket, and walked out into the light. The silent theater immediately roared back to life, all 2,500 people there clapping and cheering for him before he'd even said a word. As he took the podium, he couldn't help but grin like an idiot. "Thank you, Barnaul!" he said, the speakers allowing him to make himself heard over the clamor.\n\nThe speech was supposed to last thirty minutes but with the audience cheering and chanting it stretched to almost an hour. Additional speakers outside the theater delivered Shukshin's words to the even larger crowd outside on the streets. The next morning the headline in every major newspaper in the federation was about Shukshin's rally. Most touted it as a huge victory, a massive sign of enthusiasm for the opposition candidate. Even papers loyal to Pokryshkin couldn't help but acknowledge that the rally had been a success for his opponent."

 PAV_elections.5.desc:0 "Dmitry Glinka read over the memo he'd just received. It came straight from Pokryshkin, and stamped across the top in bold red letters were the words TOP SECRET. Very subtle, Glinka thought to himself. He'd been expecting this memo, or one like it, for quite a while. Pokryshkin was in a reelection campaign and according to the polls it was closer than anyone suspected it could have been at the start of the race. If the boss wanted to be certain of victory, he would have to stop playing nice and get down in the mud, or at least send someone in for him. It seemed that responsibility had fallen on the SB. It made sense that it would. After all, dirty work was what they did best.\n\nGlinka was surprised by the plain wording of the letter. He was used to politicians beating around the bush and trying to maintain a degree of plausible deniability when asking for his help. Pokryshkin had made no such effort here, meaning he was either braver, dumber, or more desperate that Glika had assumed. The order said plainly that the SB was to investigate the leading figures of the opposition and find any secrets from their past they might be trying to conceal from voters. Even more plainly, it said that if the SB could not find sufficient evidence of any scandals, it was authorized to fabricate some in order to "Preserve the stability of the federation."\n\nGlinka chuckled. He'd already dug into Shukshin and most of his cronies, and they were all as clean as a whistle. If only he'd been working for them, he would have had no trouble at all bringing Pokryshkin's corruption to light, but that was not the way things had worked out, was it? The president was the one who paid him, and it was time to earn his keep. Shukshin was running to the left of Pokryshkin on several major issues. That was as good a place to start as any."

 PAV_elections.51.desc:0 "SHUKSHIN ACCUSED OF WORKING WITH COMMUNIST AGENTS!\n\nA NEW RED MENACE FOR RUSSIA?\n\nOPPOSITION CAMPAIGN MANAGER ARRESTED!\n\nIgor looked over the newspapers, trying to decide which one he wanted. He usually preferred the Morning Post, but recently it had appointed a new editor and had been slowly becoming a mouthpiece for Pokryshkin's government. Not that that mattered today. Every paper, even the ones that were usually anti-government, was carrying a story about Shukshin speaking to some socialist labor leaders last week or about his campaign manager benign arrested yesterday. Igor was already caught up on the communist story so he grabbed the paper with the article on the campaign manager, paid the vendor, and took a seat at a bench.\n\nThe article detailed the arrest and charging of the campaign manager. Apparently, he'd been caught involved in some corrupt dealings trying to rig vote collection in a precinct near Tomsk. He'd already been released on bail but his trial was scheduled for only a week before an election and the newspaper speculated that he would probably be replaced in the coming days. Shukshin, for his part, denied all of the charges and accused the government of fabricating the evidence to disrupt his election bid. Igor was surprised by that. Sure, everyone knew the government was corrupt, but it wouldn't go as far as to just make up evidence would it?\n\nIgor put the paper away and sighed. He didn't normally follow politics, but he had recently. He used to think every politician was just a corrupt, dishonest man looking to make his money off the work of the common people, but Shukshin had made him reconsider that belief. He'd sounded like he genuinely wanted to help in his speeches and writings, but it seemed that he and his allies were just as deceitful as the people in charge right now. If that was the case, Igor thought, he would probably just not bother voting this time either. If nothing would change, what was the point?"

Not that it mattered, they were all telling the same story, the only story anyone was talking about today. A memo supposedly written by President Pokryshkin to the head of the SB had been leaked. No one but the leaker knew how it got out, but now the front page of every newspaper bore the same picture of a note with the words TOP SECRET printed atop it in bright red and bearing the President's signature at the bottom. The contents of the letter were brief but clear. The SB was ordered to go digging into the past of Shukshin and his associates looking for scandals, and to make some up if they couldn't find any real ones.\n\nIgor picked a paper he knew had a cartoonist he liked and settled in to read further. Shukshin was accusing the President of corrupt and tyrannical behavior, and was calling on the people of the federation to turn out and vote to reject this sort of treatment. Pokryshkin, for his part, was denying everything and dismissed the story as a hoax by the opposition to portray him as a dictator. He had refused to comment on the fact that the signature on the letter matched his perfectly, and it appeared to have been printed on notarized paper from his office.\n\nIgor felt himself getting angrier and angrier as he read the story. He'd known Pokryshkin was corrupt, but he never thought he'd stoop as low as trying to frame his opponent. Igor was not normally a political man. He considered most politicians to be liars and thieves regardless of party or position, but the President had gone too far this time. Igor had heard some of Shukshin's speeches, and he'd been interested but he hadn't made up his mind until now. The election was coming soon, and when it arrived, he'd be sure to cast his ballot for the man that deserved to lead Russia, not the one leading it now"
