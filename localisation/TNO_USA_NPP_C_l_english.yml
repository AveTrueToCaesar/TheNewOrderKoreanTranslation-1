NPP의 통합 전선에서 균열이 나타나기 시작하고 있으며, 각 카운티에서 주까지 공화-민주당은 이미 그의 입법을 확고히 하기로 약속했습니다. 하지만 미국의 억압받는 사람들은 이제 그들이 그의 형제에게 했던 것처럼 그에게 희망을 바라봅니다. 잭이 마지막 순간에도 결코 그만두지 않았고, 바비 역시 그만두지 않을 것입니다."

RFK는 특히 그들의 사회 자유주의 정책과 복지 국가에 대한 진보적인 견해를 놓고 공화당과 협력하겠다는 새로운 정책을 발표했습니다. 공화당은 본질적으로 그들이 할 수 있는 어떤 과단성에도 응할 수 밖에 없는 상황에서 케네디의 관대한 손을 간절하게 움켜쥐었습니다. 이제 NPP와 공화당이 손잡고 일하면서 우리는 마침내 옛 미국 정치의 죽음의 고비를 잠재울 수 있습니다."

 ###### BIPARTISANSHIP EVENTS


 bobby.bipartisan.1.t:0 "The Beginning of a Beautiful Friendship"
 bobby.bipartisan.1.desc:0 "America is divided more than ever, on seemingly every issue-- economic policy, military interventions, civil rights, and just about whatever else you can fit on the nightly news. Now more than ever, however, we must bring Americans together, and create a more free, equal America.\n\nThat said, a "free, equal America" requires a lot of work to turn from fantasy to fact. The first step is securing bipartisan support in Congress, and our best bet is some kind of coalition with the more liberal Republicans. Let's show the Republicans that our values are quite similar by working on a War Powers Act together, which would limit the President's power to unilaterally plunge America into war, like in South Africa.\n\nIf they learn to like working with us on this, support for a future Civil Rights Act would be almost guaranteed!"
 bobby.bipartisan.1.a:0 "We must keep the prize in sight."

 bobby.bipartisan.2.t:0 "The First Draft"
 bobby.bipartisan.2.desc:0 "Congress, and really all of politics, is a tricky game: How far do you push your morals in favor of pragmatism, what's a vote really worth, and more.\n\nWith this bill, we're faced with a certain decision we must make as we draft the WPA. Do we make the Act as clear and direct and possible, or do we leave a few loopholes here and there? Making an airtight bill would certainly be the more moral choice and perhaps be the most popular, but if we leave even a few loopholes we could satisfy some of the warhawks in Congress."
 bobby.bipartisan.2.a:0 "Sometimes we have to focus more on what's realistic rather than what's right."
 bobby.bipartisan.2.b:0 "We came here to prevent another South Africa. Close the loopholes. "

 bobby.bipartisan.3.t:0 "The Democratic Ambush"
 bobby.bipartisan.3.desc:0 "Some of the Democrats in Congress have sprung an amendment onto the War Powers Act! They want to let the President send "training forces" without needing Congressional approval. If we let this amendment through, the whole Act becomes meaningless, since the President could still just send whatever forces he wanted under the guise of his "training forces"!\n\nAt the same time however, if we did let this amendment through, we could count on a much larger base of support in Congress.\n\nWhat should we do about this?"
 bobby.bipartisan.3.a:0 "The hell are they doing, absolutely not!"
 bobby.bipartisan.3.b:0 "Well, it couldn't hurt to have a bigger majority."

 bobby.bipartisan.4.t:0 "The Democrats Speak Out"
 bobby.bipartisan.4.desc:0 "After our refusal to incorporate their amendment, the Democrats have raised a major stink nationwide, and the latest numbers seem to suggest it has affected our polling.\nHowever, there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Although the Democrats are throwing their little tantrums, the Republicans are publicly applauding us for sticking to our guns, and LBJ even called to say congratulations! Who knew such a dreadful man had a heart!"
 bobby.bipartisan.4.a:0 "The Republicans are all that matter."

 bobby.bipartisan.5.t:0 "The End of the Honeymoon"
 bobby.bipartisan.5.desc:0 "Some diehard dove Republicans have raised hell over our decision to incorporate the Democratic amendment in the War Powers Act. For now, these Republicans are mostly on the fringe, but it could spell disaster down the line. We can't go back on the promise to go for the Democratic amendment, but we do have to make sure that we don't rock the boat too much in the future so our coalition stays secure. We need to make sure the Republicans can and do trust us!"
 bobby.bipartisan.5.a:0 "So much for reaching across the aisle..."

 bobby.bipartisan.6.t:0 "The Passing of the War Powers Act"
 bobby.bipartisan.6.desc:0 "With the recent Senate vote, the War Powers Act is on its way to Robert's desk, which means a victory for us and our coalition. Hypothetically, this should mean that we've achieved a great success for bipartisanship in America, but it just seems like we've dug the party trenches even deeper. We set out not only to prevent another South Africa, but to show America how to work together again, and while we got the job done in the end, the cracks we got along the way are worrying.\n\nStill, what's done is done, and we must look towards the future and not the past. There will likely be another opportunity to showcase bipartisanism soon, and to guarantee the Republicans that we're the people to work with when it comes to civil rights."
 bobby.bipartisan.6.a:0 "A win is a win, onto the next bill."

 bobby.bipartisan.7.t:0 "Grumbles in the NPP-FR"
 bobby.bipartisan.7.desc:0 "Some far right members of the NPP are complaining that we give the executive branch too much power in the War Powers Act-- they fear that we'll do the same when it comes to civil rights, which they view as undue government tyranny.\n\nThis is, of course, absurd, but we could count on more complete Congressional support if we alter the language of the Act somewhat, even if we might scare off a few Republicans."
 bobby.bipartisan.7.a:0 "Well, a little alteration couldn't hurt."
 bobby.bipartisan.7.b:0 "We can't go back now, send the bill to the floor."

 bobby.bipartisan.8.t:0 "The Elephant Blows its Trunk"
 bobby.bipartisan.8.desc:0 "After altering the language of the War Powers Act to please the NPP-FR, the Republicans are worried we'll just bend over to the NPP-FR when it comes to civil rights! They're concerned we won't stick to our guns and get a square deal for all Americans, with LBJ himself trumpeting this line from every talk show in the nation. Unfortunately, it's too late to back out of the alterations, but hopefully the Act will still make it out of Congress with the new FR support. This does not bode well for our future cooperation."
 bobby.bipartisan.8.a:0 "Why does bipartisanship have to be so hard?"

 bobby.bipartisan.9.t:0 "The Right Speaks Out"
 bobby.bipartisan.9.desc:0 "Our recent refusal to tone down the War Powers Act in accordance with the NPP-FR demand to alter the language of the Act has earned us some respect with anti-segregationists and civil rights leaders, but it has also led to Strom Thurmond and George Wallace decrying our so called "undignified, callous, and immature conduct.'' Thankfully, this hasn't led to any serious implications, and what limited impact it has led to will most likely fade with time. We have even had some of our Republican colleagues speak out to the press in support of our Administration after refusing to let them in."
 bobby.bipartisan.9.a:0 "Why does bipartisanship have to be so damn hard?"

 bobby.bipartisan.10.t:0 "Drafting the Enviromental Protections Act"
 bobby.bipartisan.10.desc:0 "America has always been a land of progress, with each new era bringing new innovations and opportunities through the wonders of science and industry. But progress comes with a cost. The ravages of unchecked development has waged devastation upon the great beauty of nature, and the skies choke with smog just as the land lies awash with waste. Something must be done to ensure that we do not squander the bounty of our great country.\nOur newest bill would introduce a slew of environmental protections and regulations aimed at reducing the impact of human development on the natural world. Businesses and government institutions would be encouraged to monitor and reduce their reliance on polluting chemicals, inefficient practices and irresponsible waste disposal, among other such ills. Certain incentives to help encourage the adoption of green policies are also included in the bill, including increased taxation on pollutive products and subsidies for organizations that adopt environmentally-friendly initiatives.\nBefore we submit this bill, we must figure out our strategy. Our cooperation with the Republican-Democrats has presented an opportunity we may be able to exploit in this matter. A number of Democrat senators have expressed a great passion for the cause of environmental protection, and if we were to offer them a seat at the table to help draft the bill, we could shore up their support for when it comes time to vote. On the other hand, their passion may prove rather... counterproductive, as they will certainly request that we include even stronger protections that may not prove as palatable to the rest of the government.\nThe decision lies with President Kennedy, who is willing to pursue any avenue in the interests of defending America's natural beauty."
 bobby.bipartisan.10.a:0 "Invite the Democrats to the table!"
 bobby.bipartisan.10.b:0 "In times like this, it's best to be safe."

 bobby.bipartisan.11.t:0 "A Firmer Hand on the Environment"
 bobby.bipartisan.11.desc:0 "The Democrats have been eager to work with us in developing the Environmental Act, and lengthy discussions about the bill's contents have taken place over the last few days. As expected, however, our decision to include them may come at a cost.\nWhile they have welcomed the protections offered by the bill, the Democrats say they do not go far enough, for they claim that sufficiently wealthy and powerful organizations would freely be able to ignore the regulations if the profit remained sufficient. Rather than a carrot, we need a stick, they say. Among their proposed amendments include rendering certain particularly ecologically-damaging practices illegal, with significant fines and sanctions for those companies who continue to engage in them. In addition, they also seek the creation of a government watchdog that would be able to investigate organizations that flaunted environmental law and enforce fines on those they find in violation of the regulations.\nThough these suggestions would certainly make a difference for the environment, there are many who would balk at such an interventionist approach. Passing the bill with their amendments attached may prove even more difficult than if we had just tried to do it alone, and it may be better to quit while we're ahead and cut the Democrats back out of the discussions. Opening the door only to slam it back in their faces, however, might not be the best look for us."
 bobby.bipartisan.11.b:0 "It will be tough, but they're right. Make it stronger!"
 bobby.bipartisan.11.a:0 "Surely there is a middle ground here?"
 bobby.bipartisan.11.c:0 "This was a bad idea, reject the amendments."


 bobby.bipartisan.12.t:0 "An Avalanche of Calls"
 bobby.bipartisan.12.desc:0 "When President Kennedy opened the morning paper to find the draft of the Environmental Act staring back at him from page 3, he had cursed under his breath. Some careless staffer must have left a copy lying around for any old gumshoe journalist to find, and now the full draft of the bill was available for all to see. Already there was some consternation in the papers about the Democrats' amendments, and President Kennedy groaned at the knowledge that he had no doubt drawn the ire of some very powerful people.\nAt half past nine, the first phone call arrived, and they would seemingly never cease until well into the evening. Many different people could be heard on the other end, but they could have essentially been considered the same - all a bunch of lobbyists. Lobbyists for Mobil, Pacific Gas & Electric, Chevron, all manner of names that held so much clout in places that they really shouldn't. The calls were generally brief, but equally terse and all with the same message. 'Stop it.'\nThe demands of the lobbyists were simple. Dilute the terms of the bill and cease trying to cut into their profits. If the government refused, they vowed to use whatever resources were at their disposal to drown the NPP in bad press and flood the heartlands of the oil and energy industries with ads attacking the party. Heartlands like the Southwest and the Midwest, where the companies were essentially institutions in their own right who the working man looked to to provide his daily bread. Certainly, not men who would take kindly to their great corporate benefactors not being able to create as many jobs due to government meddling.\nBy sundown President Kennedy was no longer hiding his cursing. He knew he was in a bind, and was faced with a choice. If he continued down this path, he'd almost certainly lose some of the Midwestern states and quite possibly the next election. But was the defence of the natural world and the great green Earth that he and three billion people shared not more important than votes?\nWith one final expletive, he picked up the now silent phone and called the bill drafting committee, ready at last to inform them of his decision."
 bobby.bipartisan.12.a:0 "We have no choice. Tone down the bill."
 bobby.bipartisan.12.b:0 "Lobbyists be damned, this is for the future."


 bobby.bipartisan.13.t:0 "An Offer from the Right"
 bobby.bipartisan.13.desc:0 "As heated discussion over the strengthened Environmental Act continues, one might have expected the Far-Right sister faction to the Center NPP to be the angriest voice of them all. Yet discussions between the two broken halves have proven oddly civil. The Right is aware of President Kennedy's intentions and passes no ill judgement on his commitment to the environment. In fact, the most recent talks saw senior Far-Right leaders offer up the possibility of them supporting the bill through both branches of government. In return for concessions, of course.\nThe heartlands of the Right's voter base rely on industries that utilize un-green practices, and while tackling the pollution of the land we live in may be a moral imperative, it should not come at the cost of the average working man who put their faith in our party. So say the Far-Right, the clear solution is to press the regulations on a national scale, but allow certain exemptions at the state level so that more traditional industries can keep their overhead manageable. This, along with some other business-friendly amendments, would take the harsh bite out of the bill in the eyes of many businesses and business interests.\nWe need support to get our radical plan through, and perhaps allowing a few dissenters to cut themselves loose of the regulations is acceptable if most of the nation will still follow them. But it does leave a sour taste in the mouth..."
 bobby.bipartisan.13.a:0 "Let them have their exemptions."
 bobby.bipartisan.13.b:0 "Are you mad? Laws isn't optional!"


 bobby.bipartisan.14.t:0 "Johnson's Ire"
 bobby.bipartisan.14.desc:0 ""And so you would bring our brethren to your table with promises to hear them, to fulfil the promise our parties made to each other to put the cause of America before our own differences, and then at the first sign of making real progress you turn them away because it is not convenient? For shame, Mr President."\nLyndon B. Johnson's words today echo the frustrations heard within both factions of his party. Having brought the Democrats to the table, only to turn them away immediately upon the realization that their desires may be bad for the NPP, has been regarded as an insult and a betrayal not just to the Democrats, but to their Republican allies as well. Having previously agreed to cooperate with the R-Ds on matters such as these, so readily cutting them off may not have been the most stellar optics for us.\nJohnson and his allies in the halls of power have banded together in an alliance that threatens to tear apart the agreement between our two parties. They are demanding that we reopen negotiations and take the Democrats' views on board before they consider voting for the bill along with further input from the Republicans, and they are making it very clear that they will make things very, very difficult for us if we refuse.\nOur image in the eyes of the R-Ds does not look good right now, and yet if we acquiesce and are seen so willingly bowing before the demands of the opposition, the loss of voter confidence in us could be very damaging indeed. Today is a stressful day for President Kennedy."
 bobby.bipartisan.14.a:0 "Damn it all! Just give them what they want."
 bobby.bipartisan.14.b:0 "No means no, this is OUR bill too."


 bobby.bipartisan.15.t:0 "The Environmental Act Passes!"
 bobby.bipartisan.15.desc:0 "After all the haggling, debating and careful politicking of the last few months, our environmental bill has finally passed through the halls of power and emerged as law! With the only formality remaining being the signing of the bill into law by President Kennedy's own hand, a new dawn awaits this fair land of America. No more will selfish corporations be permitted to blindly squander the natural beauty of our country in the name of a quick profit, nor will the government itself turn a blind eye to the abuses against fair Mother Nature.\nNot only is this a great day for our natural splendour, but also a great day for everyone in the halls of power. Our close cooperation with the Republican-Democrats in getting this bill through proves just how much the government can achieve when it stops bickering amongst itself and instead finds common ground. Many with the R-D party ranks (and, perhaps more pertinently, within their electorate) have come to look upon us with ambivalence, if not outright favor, where before would have only been hostility.\nIn the future, we may well be able to count on their votes to back up our own. A few quiet polls and queries amongst Capitol Hill representatives has revealed that polls across the country have shifted as well."
 bobby.bipartisan.15.a:0 "Let's hope we've earned some favors..."


 bobby.bipartisan.16.t:0 "The Far-Right Requests Amendments"
 bobby.bipartisan.16.desc:0 "The first draft of the Environmental Act has arrived in Congress, and debate is already well underway. While it has been well received amongst certain members of the Center and the Republican-Democrats, others are less enthused. Some have called the bill "anti-business" and an attack on the values of the American free market, claiming that the extra costs it would cause to businesses would only lead to less jobs and a worse economy. The bill has spent the last few days under intense scrutiny from the subcommittees, and we remain far from a consensus.\nPrivately, representatives of our party's Far-Right faction have met with President Kennedy to discuss certain... adjustments to the bill that could potentially make it more palatable to them and their voters. These adjustments include granting exemptions from our proposed regulations to certain key businesses - primarily in NPP voting areas - while still "gently encouraging" more efficient practices overall. Not only would this quiet the criticisms of the more pro-business voices in Congress and help move the bill along, it would also shore up support for us amongst white collar voters who wish to see their companies prosper.\nOf course, taking the teeth out of the bill would render our whole endeavour somewhat pointless. Nonetheless, our ability to pass the bill as things stand is uncertain, and is a weak bill that passes not better than a strong bill that fails?"
 bobby.bipartisan.16.a:0 "What use is a law if nobody follows it?!"
 bobby.bipartisan.16.b:0 "They have a point. A few exemptions can't hurt."


 bobby.bipartisan.17.t:0 "The Republicans Lash Out"
 bobby.bipartisan.17.desc:0 ""A good bill, a great and necessary bill, made weak and toothless just to bow to the wishes of big business!"\nThis was the assessment of one Republican congressman today following our adjustment of the Environmental Act, and his words have been echoed by many other progressive Republicans on the floor. Safe to say, they are not happy with us acquiescing to the Far-Right's suggestions, and indeed many who formerly supported the bill now seem determined to vote against it in indignation.\nSome of the Republicans have demanded that we restore the original draft of the bill to be debated. While we have clearly lost a lot of support, going back now would perhaps place us in a worse position than to begin with, for not only will we have rankled the Republicans, but we will also have reneged on our word to our Far-Right colleagues. Still, perhaps their passion shows that the bill as it once stood had more of a chance than we thought."
 bobby.bipartisan.17.a:0 "God damn them, let's just dig up the original draft."
 bobby.bipartisan.17.b:0 "We can't keep switching it up! The bill stays."

 bobby.bipartisan.18.t:0 "The Fruits of Cooperation"
 bobby.bipartisan.18.desc:0 "Our bipartisan efforts to secure support across the aisle have earned us praise, and the senate whips have been dispatched to count up the votes. Let us hope that the Republicans come through."
 bobby.bipartisan.18.a:0 "The real prize awaits..."

"음, 의원님, 그들은 제 당 형제요. 당신에게 접근하기 전에 당내에서 일을 해결하려고 노력하는 것이 이해된다고 생각했소. 이 일이 나를 어떻게 보이게 만들지 이해하시오. 우리가 다른 당과 협력하는 것을 보고 남부 유권자들이 왜 자신들이 진보주의자로 투표했는지 궁금해하지 않기를 바랄 뿐이오."\n\n"공화민주당에 투표하는 대신? 그런 뜻이오? 바비, 만약 당신이 이 난장판을 정리하지 않는다면, 내 말은, 지금 당장 점보를 보내서 이 불평등한 협력에 큰 화를 입게 할 수 있소."\n\n케네디는 얼굴을 찡그렸습니다. 텍사스 사람만이 대통령에게 그런 식으로 말할 것입니다."

Breathing deeply, he allowed himself a moment of pure, unfiltered satisfaction. All the tumult and politicking, all the alliances he had forged and broken, had led to this moment. Exhaling, Kennedy slowly descended from the clouds into the Oval Office. Back to reality, with its harsh lights and painful compromises.\n\nKennedy felt his knees pop as he stood, followed closely by the crack of his spine as he gave it a much-needed stretch. In a minute he'd call for his secretary to bring the draft to the typing pool so they could clean it up and copy it, but for now he was simply happy to enjoy the quiet solitude of the Oval Office at twilight, where nobody was trying to take something from him.\n\nAt the realisation that it was, in fact, twilight, the President did a double take, striding to the windows. The sky had that rich saltwater taffy colour it only got for a few minutes as the sun sank below the horizon. Had he really sat there tapping away for six hours?\n\nWell, now came the hard part: getting it through Congress. No matter the terms, there would always be bastards in power who wanted nothing more than to spend their lives trying to keep black people down. Well, he thought as he sat back down, fuck 'em. They might be stuck in the days of Jefferson Davis, but America was moving on, into a brighter future.\n\nSighing, President Kennedy called for his secretary as the sun set behind him."

Would he do as he was told, or would he crush his head like an apricot in front of the audience? Nevertheless, despite his reservations, Kennedy had decided to try and compromise with Thurmond, get his boys to vote for civil rights, even if the bill had to be redrafted to be less ambitious than he had hoped. Changes could be made, as the years flew by. It wasn't a betrayal.\n\nAt least, that's what he told himself. As soon as Kennedy had taken the bait, Thurmond had reeled him in, making more and more outrageous demands, refusing to negotiate in good faith. "...and another thing, Mr. President, I reckon we oughta allow private schools to choose their own students. Shit, it ain't up to the government to force privately-owned, god-fearing institutions to take Negroes against their will."\n\nPresident Kennedy massaged his forehead between thumb and forefinger, receiver pressed to his ear. He could tell that Thurmond was trying to strongarm him. With every concession he was promised he only got more bold. It was fairly obvious that he was trying to whittle away as much of the bill as he could. Kennedy would have to let him have a few wins, but Thurmond seemed determined to gut it. It wouldn't surprise him if the Senator had a copy of the bill and a pair of scissors in front of him right now.\n\nPresident Kennedy took a deep breath while Thurmond continued to rattle off changes he wanted made. The bill getting toned down in exchange for the reactionaries' aid getting it through Congress was a given, but could he allow them to rip the heart out of it? To castrate the dream he had spent so long working towards?"

The National Progressive Party was like a creche full of squabbling toddlers, and he the teacher put in the unenviable position of forcing them to behave. Whose idea was it to form a party of segregationists and progressives, anyway? He supposed he could blame the bastard Thurmond and Henry Wallace for that one.\n\nStill, they could work together, from time to time. He wondered if it was worth the necessary compromises. The civil rights bill would get through Congress and pass into law, but had the cost been worth it? In the end, he'd stood strong, refusing to compromise on the central points, but Thurmond had still wrung some drastic changes out of him like dirty water from a dishcloth.\n\nBut that was the nature of compromise. Nobody got what they wanted and everyone ended up unhappy. Slumped in his chair, the President wondered if he should have worked harder to get Johnson and the Republicans on his side, rather than trying to co-operate with his party brothers. It would certainly have led to stronger civil rights legislation.\n\nWell, what was done was done. There was no use castigating himself for what he couldn't change. All he could do now was push the amended bill through Congress and hope that more progressive senators would be elected in the future."

Thurmond had basically kicked him over like a sapling, demanding alteration after alteration to the civil rights bill that Kennedy had felt he'd no choice but to accept to have any hope of getting the bill through Congress.\n\nFrankly, he felt ashamed. His face was burning with humiliation. Here he was, the goddamn President, and a Senator of his own party was having more of an impact on the bill than he was. And Thurmond didn't even want it in the first place. He'd basically castrated it, tearing out everything that made it righteous, leaving only token changes, minor reforms, ineffectual promises, and plenty of loopholes for Southern governors to exploit to their hearts' content. It was a massacre.\n\nAnd there was nothing he could do. The President wanted to vomit right there on the Resolute desk, disgusted at his own weakness. He'd tried to negotiate in good faith with Thurmond's reactionaries and this was the price he'd had to pay. It was better than nothing, but not much better. He'd gone into this trying to achieve the dream of equality for every American, and that dream had been sacrificed on the bloody altar of realpolitik.\n\nThe President sighed, holding his head in his hands. Millions of African-Americans looked up to him to save them, to pull them into the light, and he'd as good as betrayed them.\n\nWhen that bill passed Congress, they'd see just how wrong they had been to put their trust in him."

Looking around quickly, he slips inside.\n\nThe man flicks on a small handheld flashlight and makes his way through the familiar office. As he passes the desk that has become his, he glances briefly at the framed photograph of his wife. Unlocking the records room with a copied key, he rifles through the boxes, searching for the unmarked manila folder that is the object of his search. Pulling it out, he takes a photograph of each page of the document with his little Minox camera before putting it back in its place. It's strange, he thinks, as he makes his way back to his car, that something so innocuous could have the power to change a nation.\n\nThe same scene plays out in a dozen other dour little offices around the country that night, with a dozen anonymous recently hired employees carrying out the orders of their true employer. The following morning at Quantico, a thousand miles distant, an analyst's eyes go wide as she reads the document from Little Rock. This, she thinks, is how we get them.

Though as yet unconfirmed, FR-NPP leaders across the nation have vehemently denounced the alleged actions of the Little Rock branch and insist that this is a local matter and is not reflective of the faction as a whole. President Kennedy spoke briefly on the issue this morning at a publicity event in Baltimore, saying that "Americans have put their trust in me and I will personally ensure that the cancer eating away at the Party is excised in the name of justice for everyone in this great nation." This is just the latest in a string of disappointments for the Far Right faction, already significantly declined in influence following the election of the President and the rise of his Center faction to party dominance.

Although it is not altogether clear at this stage, an anonymous source claims that evidence indicates that the ballot-stuffing conspiracy to win key areas for the Far Right faction is widespread across the South and Midwest and that several of the faction's leaders were aware of it and supported the practice to harm the powerful Center faction. Speaking from a Baltimore publicity event this morning, President Kennedy said "Americans elected the NPP to root out the injustices of this great nation of ours, and I will not turn a blind eye to the crimes of those cancerous individuals eating away at our own party. Rest assured that those responsible for this travesty will be found and made to answer for their actions, and those groups within the party that seek to contravene our goals will be cast down". Party sentiment appears to be heavily with the President as all across the nation calls have begun for major members of the Far Right faction to step down.

Using the FBI as his own personal army of spies, Hoover has become one of the most powerful and feared men in the country, covertly infiltrating government organizations all across America, allegedly amassing a huge quantity of blackmail material, and carrying out clandestine and often illegal operations. In essence, they're a shadow government within the government, infesting our institutions like dormant tuberculosis bacteria, just waiting for the conditions to be right for them to awaken.\n\nThis has to stop. Though he should be our obedient underling, Hoover has effectively become a rogue spymaster with an unprecedented level of power and clout, and his interests are very often at odds with our own. He's far too entrenched in the FBI to be effectively neutralized, but perhaps we can give him a bit of his own medicine to get a leash on him and stop his unethical operations.\n\nThere have been unseemly rumours about Hoover and his long-time protege Clyde Tolson floating around for decades, involving all-male parties and furtive visits from handsome young men in the middle of the night. Hoover may like dirty tricks, but two can play at that game. Let's fling his closet open and see what skeletons fall out."

Even more interestingly, we got some pictures of Hoover and Tolson meeting with a pair of handsome young men in the hotel bar and taking them up to their room.\n\nAll you have to do is a little bit of digging and all of a sudden you're turning up yellowed old skeletons all over the place.

From the records that remain it appears that Hoover has been using the FBI as his own personal army, sending agents to acquire blackmail material on important figures and extrajudicially pursuing suspected criminals.\n\nAmong the less shocking stuff, in a number of redacted files, our agents have uncovered evidence of a secret program called COINTELPRO. We don't have all the facts so far, but it appears to be an intelligence gathering program focused on somewhat vaguely-chosen "enemies of the nation", most notable civil rights leaders. Hoover apparently authorized the use of illegal tactics to gather information on these people and to harass them into silence and inaction.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a complete and total violation of the victims' rights and is a subversion of everything President Kennedy stands for.

When he was alone with his most trusted underlings- as well as Hoover- he began.\n\n"Mr. Hoover, so far we've discussed the principles and functions of the COINTELPRO program.

"However, it strikes me that it would be a colossal waste of resources to simply cancel the program."\n\nThat got some odd looks from Humphrey and the others. Hoover narrowed his eyes in appraisal. Kennedy continued, "It has occurred to me that with minimal difficulty this program could be repurposed to... investigate... certain reactionary elements that oppose the goals and ideals of this administration.

Kennedy tracked him with narrowed eyes.\n\n"It seems you've made some decisions I wasn't consulted on," began Humphrey acerbically, tossing Kennedy a sidelong glance.\n\n"I am not beholden to you, Hubert," replied the President dryly, holding himself tall. "Not every ruler feels the need to consult their vizier before every little decision."\n\nHumphrey stopped stock still and spun to Kennedy. "Good God, man! Can you hear yourself? You're speaking like a Roman Emperor, a petty Caesar!" His face was becoming ruddy. "You want to use Hoover's goons to investigate our own party? It's vile! I won't condone it! The purpose of curtailing injustice is lost when you achieve it through the methods of a tyrant!"\n\nKennedy remained coolly detached through Humphrey's tirade. He took a sharp breath. "Hubert, would St. George have tried to slay the dragon without a sword? We can't stay on the high road when our enemies prove that they are willing, again and again, to stoop to the dirtiest tactics available to them. A weapon is just a weapon, it is neither good nor evil, only a tool for the man who wields it to impose his will on the world. We will use the FBI to purge the enemies of justice from America. That's all there is to it." And with that closing remark, he turned on his heel, opened the door, and strode purposefully from the room.\n\nHumphrey's shoulders slumped.

This epidemic of racist violence against American citizens by the men who are being paid to protect them must be stopped.\n\nThis morning, President Kennedy gave a speech at the Capitol virulently denouncing the systemic racism of law enforcement, and promising to root out the un-American racists entrenched within the nation's police.

I went to you first as a friend, now you make me come to you as the Vice President. This is a formal complaint."\n\nKennedy slammed his fists down on the desk, suddenly full of vitriol. Humphrey narrowed his eyes. Kennedy had been flying off the handle more and more often lately whenever he was challenged. "Do you two," began Kennedy, barely keeping his rage in check, "know who you're talking to? I'm the goddamn President! I have no choice, this has to be done if we want to keep Thurmond and Eastland's minions in check. When the President does it, that means it's not illegal. Believe me, this is the right thing to do, the only thing to do! This is how we save the nation!" He raised his arms above him and stared up at the immaculately whitewashed ceiling.\n\nLater, when he was seething alone in the Oval Office, Kennedy found his thoughts circling invariably back to Clark and Humphrey.

Our friends have distanced themselves and even our staunchest allies won't return our calls.

The Kennedy Administration teeters on the edge of annihilation as discussion of impeachment begins behind closed doors.\n\nIn the Oval Office, the President sits slumped in his chair. He hasn't moved for almost fifteen full minutes and can't seem to find the will to do anything. Kennedy sighed, looking around at the room that had once played host to both his father and his brother. How would he be remembered now? As a stalwart of civil rights, an enemy of injustice and a champion of progress, or as a cowardly, corrupt slimeball who used his power to contravene the Constitution and to send an army of spies against his political adversaries?\n\nKennedy clenched his hands into fists and sat up. No, he couldn't let himself fall into despair. For God's sake, he was the President! I have to move forward, he thought, as he picked up the phone. This can't be the end.

Now Clark was out of the picture, there was nobody to stop the expansion of COINTELPRO and his campaign to end injustice could continue unimpeded. After all, a weapon is just a weapon. In the hands of a good man, it is an instrument of good. Now nobody would ever know he had done it, and his legacy as an icon of progressivism was ensured.

Restricting redlining will be very unpopular with business owners and bankers, as well as the wider white population in general, but the unpopularity of our policies has never stopped us from trying to do the right thing before.\n\nTo deal with redlining, we could either do what's right and go hard on banning the practice, erasing every loophole, or we could try and preserve some of our political capital and put some small but meaningful restrictions into place instead.

All in all, we've been able to remove one of the biggest obstacles to the racial integration of America's neighbourhoods, and for once doing the right thing wasn't painful at all!"

This morning, one such incident arising from integration pushback appeared on the front page of President Kennedy's newspaper, making him cringe from something other than his morning grapefruit.\n\nApparently, a pair of black teenagers whose family has recently moved into a previously redlined suburb in Atlanta attempted to order lunch at the local greasy spoon diner and the owner, one Lester Maddox, refused to serve them and asked them to leave. Despite this obviously being illegal since the passing of the Civil Rights Act, Maddox's supposed right to choose his customers has become Dixie's cause du jour, and Maddox has already appeared on several right-leaning Southern radio stations bemoaning the sudden change in his community's demographic makeup.\n\nWe have to respond to this quickly before it spirals out of control, to make it publicly known that the regressive racism of Maddox and his ilk has no place in modern America. However, despite being a thoroughly unpleasant man, Maddox has gained a strong measure of support from Southern whites and reactionaries everywhere. We could formally prosecute him to make an example at the risk of stoking the political fire, or we could give him a slap on the wrist to make our disapproval known without starting a fight."

Nevertheless, this was the right thing to do. People need to understand that integration is the future and they need to accept it if they want to do business.

This great nation was founded by men of many backgrounds and cultures, who came together to create a common bond between them all, to create a nation in which all would have the same rights and privileges and could enjoy freedom and liberty without impediment. America was founded on the principle that all of its citizens would be free and equal, and the freedom of all of our citizens is diminished when not all Americans are equal. Are we to say that this is the land of the free for all but those with black skin? From now on, when some of the less enlightened say that black children should be excluded from white schools, we will respond with a resounding 'No'. In our ongoing fight against injustice, we will promote the integration of schools across America, so that all of our nation's children are privy to the same essential rights and opportunities."\n\nThe press pounced on that like hyenas on an injured gazelle, knowing full well that discussion of integration would stoke the flames of controversy.

Leroy could hardly believe his eyes as he was shown the vast collection of equipment his new school had for experiments. His teacher taught the class the basic principles of chemistry by showing them how to make 'elephant toothpaste'. Leroy oohed and aahed alongside his new classmates as the black goop shot out of the tube.\n\n12:30: English Literature. Every student was handed a copy of Huckleberry Finn, which Leroy was surprised to learn was his to keep. At his old school they never had enough books for everyone. The students took turns to read it aloud, and he felt everyone's eyes on him when the boy next to him suddenly stopped as he came to the word "nigger". For a moment the boy seemed to be at a loss for words, then he skipped it over, and the tension abated. It made Leroy feel awkward.\n\n4:30: Hometime. Leroy said goodbye to the trio of boys he'd befriended at recess and made his way outside, trying to ignore the eyes of some of the other students and their parents boring through him like a drill. He'd known from the beginning that being the school's first black kid wasn't going to be easy, but he was sure he'd be able to win them over in time.

Despite their pretensions at self-determination, states are still heavily dependent on federal funding to stay afloat, particularly poorer Southern states.

Goldwater as President, there's a sobering thought. Thankfully, for the time being at least, he's powerless to prevent the cause of justice and our bill sailed through Congress, making our prison reforms law.

Their wives and daughters weep on television screens all over America.\n\nThe South is ready to explode, and the rest of the country isn't much better. People are in an uproar over what they see as the government murdering people who were protesting against their breaking the First Amendment.

Without the reactionary bigwigs in the party, President Kennedy knew he had little hope of wrangling Congress or getting his legislation through. It often seemed strange that he had to draft a civil rights bill alongside people who were so staunchly against the cause of justice, but American politics hadn't been the same since the war. In his quiet moments, he often found himself wondering what Jack would have done. What his father would have done. Would they have worked with people like this, to try and better America? Was it worth whatever price he'd end up having to pay?\n\nPutting on his brave face, President Kennedy held individual meetings with each of the reactionaries' strongmen (and woman) to hear their thoughts on the bill. Careful not to make any promises or acquiesce to any of their demands (pardon, 'suggestions'), the President assured them that he valued the party's unity above all, and that he would not go ahead with civil rights legislation without the full support of the party.\n\nPrivately, he knew it would cost him.

The passage of the Civil Rights Act is an extraordinary step forward for all of us but, today, our struggles are not over. While the equality we strive for has now been codified, we must maintain our commitment to the downtrodden across America and refuse to withdraw into complacency. Unfortunately, we must still come to terms with the root of the issue.\n\nAcross the country, the remnants of prejudice continue to fester, many unabated by the legislation we have passed. While the blatant and ugly efforts of states to segregate the races of America have been dashed, the echoes from earlier times have nonetheless persisted. To many, these institutions are a fact of life, for good or ill, but our nation was not founded on the principles espoused by America's founders. I call on all citizens of the United States to look at ourselves and our society critically, and question some of the things we take for granted.

The collective nightmares of a nation and all its complexes have come true time and time again.

On my travels across this great nation, the world's richest, I have seen into the abyss of poverty that so many of our brothers and sisters are born into and die in, a miasma of depression from which there is no escape, even for the willing, who are not provided the tools and resources to better their lives. It is a fallacy, too often espoused by the callous and uncaring, that people who are in poverty choose to be there, or are rightfully deprived of the means to the pursuit of happiness due to their colour, or class, or faith. When any American denies to extend a helping hand to his fellow citizen, he denies America. Some are happy to turn their heads, or to snatch crumbs out of the mouths of the hungry, but I will not stand idly by while American children starve, while American women die in childbirth, while American workers are paid too little to support their families. We are better than that. We have the means to lift every American out of the depths of poverty, and I intend to make that beautiful dream a reality. In the coming years, my administration will dedicate itself to the creation of innovative new agencies and programs to provide much-needed welfare to impoverished Americans nationwide. We shall not rest until every American is provided the means to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, those three unalienable rights that have been denied to all too many.

While often allied on many issues, the few conflicting points are just that much harder to deal with.\n\n On one hand, you have the union guys: labor leaders seeking to expand the power of worker's unions in the face of the big corporations and hostile moneyed interests, protecting and increasing the rights to collective bargaining, safer working conditions, and job security. On the other hand are the social welfare proponents: seeking to strengthen the "safety net" to catch those that fall through the cracks, tackling poverty and homelessness, and giving every American the chance to make a decent living, usually through higher taxes on the rich.\n\n The problem is that it's damn near impossible to push both agendas at the same time, partially due to the opposition that would come from those rich and powerful fatcats that would rather keep their power over the workers and their vast fortunes away from those that need it. So that leaves the President with two options: either focus his political capital on trying to boost pensions for the public and private sector that will help unionized workers, or to increase the federal minimum wage to help those stuck on the bottom of society.

But the speech has also outrage from across the nation. Many citizens are considering what the President has said as little more than slander, painting all the cops in the nation based on a few bad apples. Police unions from New York to Los Angeles are in an uproar, denouncing the President and vowing to use their resources to support politicians that actually give a damn about the police and public safety.\n\nEven in the National Progressive Party, RFK has received major blowback. Some in the FR-NPP have denounced the President, saying that he's not patriotic enough to support those that preserve law and order. Some have even shifted their loyalty from the NPP to the Democrats in response. Meanwhile, some members of the C-NPP, especially those that are really more concerned with the threat posed from outside the nation by Japan and fascism than with civil rights in America, are moving into the FR-NPP camp, thinking that the President has gone too far. After all, police forces from the FBI to county sheriffs have been busy trying to root out the dangers of spies and agitators, and it's not helping to have their methods and motives questioned.\n\nNeedless to say, the speech may have done a lot to expose the bad aspects of the men (and the slowly increasing number of women) who police the nation and their power, but the political cost to Bobby Kennedy could have been much stronger than he could have anticipated."

Looking around the room, she saw black and white children sitting together as though the barriers that had separated them for decades had never existed at all.\n\nAngie had never considered herself political until '64, when her family began speaking about Kennedy as though he was some kind of messiah. She'd been dubious, but had voted for him anyway, hoping against hope that he would prove worthy of their trust.\n\nAll things considered, she was proud she'd voted for him. The wounds of four hundred years wouldn't be mended in an instant, but she didn't fear for the new generation like she used to. It was the little things, like how her white students shared their lunch with their new black friends, and held hands as they crossed the road without so much as a flinch. After centuries of oppression, Angie felt that President Kennedy had finally set America on the path to reconciliation."

The only thing keeping him going, sleepless night after sleepless night, were his dreams of someday throwing his academic cap in the air.\n\nShelving cereal boxes on autopilot, Joe found himself remembering the news report he'd caught on CBS the previous weekend. Apparently, President Kennedy had given a speech on the importance of education for America's youth and expressed support for working class people going to college. Joe had been surprised to hear that, after years of his parents telling him that politicians didn't care about people like them. Maybe the President was just trying to garner votes, but did his intention really matter so long as he kept his word?\n\nFinishing the cereal, Joe got to work on the coffee and tea. Was it possible that the President really cared about people like him? Joe had been too young to vote in '64, but even if he had been old enough he his family's lack of faith in the establishment, formed after generations of alienation and disenfranchisement, would likely have kept him from the polling booth.

Back in '64, Sol had voted for the first time since coming to America in 1938, finally finding in Kennedy a politician he could believe in. Still, when he considered the President's actions since the election, he had to admit to a certain... disappointment. Sol could hardly call him a conservative, but he'd not quite lived up to the promise of liberal reform he'd embodied back then either.\n\nSol was too old to believe in a messiah, but he couldn't help but feel faintly betrayed. Yet, he supposed, it was hardly uncommon in America to say one thing and mean another. Shit, they were better than the Nazis, but even so they were a nation of swindlers and con-men at heart. Still, perhaps the President was just having trouble getting things done with all them dumkopfs in Congress?

But there are some members of the C-NPP, and even further to the left, that say the bill doesn't go far enough: there will be some, like the elderly and disabbled, who will have to jump through hoops and may struggle to get the aid they need, so the restrictions should be even further loosened, and the payments increased even more.\n\n But over all, it seems that most congressmen were willing to support the Social Security Act, which will expand the number of people that can receive it, cut the red tape that drains so much money from a system that is supposed to help people who have fallen on hard times or those too old to work any more, and not belittle and humiliate them. The SSA, first and foremost, is to be a safety net to catch those that fall through society's cracks: the poor, the homeless, the injured, the elderly.\n\n In a statement released to the press after the announcement of the passing of the bill, President Kennedy said that he will be signing the law tomorrow to make it law, and thanked all those that voted in favor of the act for their "...compassion, humanity, and care for the less fortunate in our nation that would otherwise be cast aside or ignored.""

"It will never pass Congress."\n\n Well, it did.\n\n The National Healthcare Act, to be signed by President Robert Kennedy in a grand Rose Garden ceremony, is now to be the law of the land. In one of the biggest, most sweeping acts ever undertaken by the federal government, the United States' healthcare system has just been overhauled from the ground up. Every single American will soon experience the effects of the NHA, for the undoubtedly and unequivocally better.\n\n It's a massive law, and it will take a decade or more to realize the full scope. In the next few months, every hospital in the nation will become the direct property of the state it resides in. The Federal government will pay the previous owners for 75% of the value of the land and buildings, while the states provide the other 25%. Every doctor, nurse, pharmacist, dentist, specialist, technician and janitor will be employed by each state's Department of Health. For the vast majority of life-saving and life-extending procedures, there will be no direct cost to the patient, instead being paid for by a mandatory national insurance plan that will pay each state for the procedure. All private health insurance plans are to be subsumed by the national system. The NHA has mandated a minimum acceptable level of care for the nation as a whole, but will provide subsidies and payments to every state to ensure they can match, or even exceed, the minimum standards.\n\n Despite the opposition from fiscal hawks, free-market advocates, small-government supporters and the lobbyists of the health insurance and healthcare industries, support for the law is widespread across the nation. The harrowing stories of how some have been left destitute due to their medical bills, or how some were turned away from preventative treatments due to unavailability, and the many, many allegations of fraud and malpractice, shifted public support in favor of the NHA and pushed many reluctant senators to vote in favor.\n\n Now, every American, no matter their race, their income, their location or their health, can and will get the care they need."

The White House is apparently in such a state of shock at the development, that they haven't even released a statement mourning the failure of the NHA.\n\n It was to be a massive law, and it would have taken a decade or more to realize the full scope.

The NHA had mandated a minimum acceptable level of care for the nation as a whole, but would provide subsidies and payments to every state to ensure they can match, or even exceed, the minimum standards.\n\n But none of this was to be. The opposition from fiscal hawks, free-market advocates, small-government supporters and the lobbyists of the health insurance and healthcare industries was too much, and public support, while generally in favor of lower cost healthcare, more access, and more accountability, turned against the NHA that would have ensured those reforms. Instead, the old status quo, of denying care due to inability to pay, lack of access because of unprofitability, and the stream of fraud and malpractice allegations, will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\n It remains to be seen if universal healthcare will ever be given to the American people."

As the wind rushed in from Lake Michigan at the soup kitchen on Lake Paulina street, chilling him to his bones, he cupped the bowl delicately as he turned into the shelter, not wanting to waste a single drop before he could guzzle it down. \n\nHe didn't make eye contact with the young woman who had handed him the bowl. She was younger than the usual crowd manning the soup line, who would sometimes look at Alfred with a mixture of disdain and self importance. Charity, they called it; and while Alfred was grateful to have a square meal a day on the freezing streets, he'd prefer it if it didn't come with a side of pitying condescension. \n\n"You forgot this!" A tug on his elbow brought Alfred back to his senses, as the young woman from the line pushed a bundle of crackers, an apple, and a few sachets of powders, stamped with 'Vitamin Supplements - American Economic Opportunity Commission' on the side. "For the soup. You won't catch a cold or the flu with that." \n\n"Thanks," Alfred grunted, pointedly refusing to pick up the vitamins. "Don't you have things to be doing?" \n\nThe lady blinked, but never broke eye contact with Alfred, before replying:"

"We've got to make sure there's enough soup for tomorrow. People just aren't donating like they used to, ever since the President's bill failed in Congress." \n\nA man shuffled up to Emily, his jacket and pants worn to tatters even as he refused to shiver in the frigid chill. He was one of the regulars, she remembered; the man would never make eye contact, just holding himself still until he got his share, unbowed by cold or circumstance. \n\nThe scrape of metal ladle on steel saucepan brought them all back to attention.

The fact that neither side agrees on precisely what those reforms will entail only adds to the mystique surrounding this sudden bipartisan shift.\n\nThe next logical step would be to make what is already obvious public knowledge: by consolidating the support of what some are describing as the "Newer Dealers", Harrington's circle will be able to force a confrontation with the conservatives in the NPP, but on his terms.

When a man is blighted with an infection, you must swab out the deepest of the diseased tissue to ensure that he might recover to walk again. So too has Harrington worked tirelessly to address the many afflictions blighting our great nation. The blight of racial inequality, educational deficit, monetary exploitation and unaffordable healthcare may not be entirely eliminated, but the treatment we have laid out should help these wounds to heal over time.\n\nWith these evils addressed, we can better fulfill the promise of our founders, and ensure that every American may have the same foundations from which to make use of every opportunity our nation has to offer. No longer shall there be an 'Other' America, but one America, united in equality, justice and liberty."

The job is not just a means of providing for the family; the availability of food and income, socioeconomic access and respect it provides is a necessity for dignified existence. And to be poor in the Land of the Free is to live a life that is a subtle slavery from cradle to grave.\n\nThe President intends to remedy this situation. The Food Stamp Programme has been touted as the remedy to aiding material poverty, but Harrington believes it is simply the first step on a road to true equality. Magnificent blueprints are being drawn up for expanded welfare schemes and far-reaching workers' rights laws, sanctifying the rights of all Americans in or out of the workplace to be protected and secure in his living conditions. When all is finished, the American worker will be truly endowed with the dignity and respect he deserves."

This includes American fathers, mothers, workers, children, and even veterans of the Second World War. This is unacceptable, and it ought to be our priority to pass legislation to make sure each get the chance to feed themselves, even if they cannot afford it by normal means. This means drafting the program, and then moving onto larger obstacles, such as raising eligibility to enter the program, and focusing on how these great Americans can ensure they are fed."

Thus, we must be able to manage between solving the crisis and making the program digestible by those begrudging members of Congress. No matter what, it would be dishonest to claim that we are the champions of freedom and inequality with a government not providing to those afflicted with the dark shadow of starvation. Even if we must fight it out in the Capitol, it is our responsibility as Americans to ensure that far more of our hungry citizens are eligible for the Food Stamp Program, one way or another!"

Supermarkets have hit a golden age in suburban American culture, and it is time for the government to capitalize on their success and implement the program heavily in Supermarkets, allowing Americans as a whole to succeed without starvation. Though opposition reigns in Washington, with a large number of Democrats in the R-D's and their fellow rightists in the NPP finding our plans to reach out to the market as being too \"radical,\" it is what our administration must do to ensure Americans can stay happy and healthy.

The way President Harrington sees it, the government owes its people a few basic things, and the most sure way to give the citizens what they are owed right now is to establish a series of federally run food banks.

Now pull your head out of your ass. That world is far, far, away from our own. The US is decidedly not the sole hegemon of the world, and we are definitely not using our armed forces to rebuild Europe and Asia. We simply don't need such a large standing army, especially when you consider the fact that large scale conventional war is essentially dead in the water thanks to M.A.D. At most, our army is going around the world containing the rise of facism through smaller proxy conflicts. With the sheer amount of money tied up in the military, wouldn't it make sense to downsize our bloated military, and use the freed up cash to pay for programs that can help Americans right now?"

The flip side of that coin, however, is that Americans are not very fond of taxes. It's a delicate balancing act; new programs are generally supported, but new taxes are reviled.

Now, thanks to Harrington's policies, even the lowliest man can be assured that he can eat and have a reasonable chance of picking himself up.\n\nThe systems we have established should ensure that the symptoms of poverty continue to be treated for the foreseeable future.

Over the last few years, the NPP has fought hard for racial equality and economic mobility for all Americans, and the President means to ensure that this ethos is maintained past his time in office.\n\nTo this end, he intends to give one of his last speeches as president at the University of Chicago, where he studied long ago. As he gives his blessing to the graduating Class of 72', he will inspire them, and hopefully all the young minds of America, with the promise of a better future that all should seek to strive for."

Though it may still exist and continue to do so, our citizens can rest assured that poverty is no longer a pit without escape, but a simple bump in the road on the path to the American Dream. With all afforded the right to healthcare in times of illness, food in times of need, freedom from racial prejudice and ready access to work and education, ascending from the darkness needn't be a Sisyphean task any longer.\n\nThe time approaches for a new president, but the efforts Harrington has made will not be in vain. America can move on into the future as one society, undivided by wealth or opportunity. In time, this may be seen as the moment that America truly fulfilled its reputation as a land where anyone can make it to greatness."

 USA_harrington_populace_fatigue_category_desc:0 "President Michael Harrington stands as the people's victor following the divisive 1968 elections, having found successes for his proclamations as "the people's choice" and a swift route for America to find themselves basking in the benefits of a Welfare-centric candidate. However, whilst he managed to secure his seat in the White House, the President must face the struggle of dealing with America's apprehension to the strong, immediate changes which Harrington seeks to implement, and deal with the consequences of their exhaustion should their outrage grow too strong. Every class of American citizen has a part to play in balancing between Harrington's success or failure, from the economically §YBourgeoisie§! to the tortured, exhausted soul of the §LOther America§!...\n\n[GetHAR_fatigue] Fatigue accumulates based on the overall enthusiasm of American society.

 USA_HAR_the_hunger_bill_desc:0 "The Presidency of Michael Harrington was heavily based upon state assistance of the less economically fortunate in American society. Some may call this assistance "socialism", but few can truly argue that it has not been a great help to the poor and homeless across the United States.

Experts believe this presages a slew of pro-labor executive orders, unburdened by Congressional gridlock, leaving the White House in the following months.

 #Events
 harrington.2.t:0 "Unity before Similarity?"
 harrington.2.desc:0 "President Michael Harrington stood in the oval office, scratching his chin, ruminating the day's events, as well as his plans for the future. When he had come into the presidency, he had campaigned on party unity heavily, trying to inextricably tie the groups such as the Far Right to the Progressives. It was unlikely to ever work, and it was very difficult so far. Strom and his cronies had trouble cooperating with anyone, the stubborn bastards, and the future of the NPP seemed in question.\nRepublicans or the Right, that was the question. Should he pick the Republicans, it could possibly dissolve the NPP as a whole; the "big tent" would be set on fire, so to speak. Regardless, a decision had to be made. Harrington picked up the phone to his personal assistant. "Francine," he said, "I'd like to schedule a meeting with Strom Thurmond.""
 harrington.2.a:0 "The Party Grows Stronger."
 harrington.3.t:0 "3 Angry Men, and a Woman"
 harrington.3.desc:0 "Robert Byrd sat at the far end of the conference room, cigar in hand. "You've got to be out of your goddamn mind," he said, "you're too out there for us, and for our supporters, Harrington. You really think we'll all just roll over for socialism? Hell, why not declare Debs one of the founding fathers? Carve his face into Rushmore and hail the People's Republic of America?"\nHarrington, sitting opposite Byrd, took a sip from his coffee mug. "I think, perhaps, you are being hyperbolic."\n"Hyperbolic!" interjected Strom Thurmond, "You're one step away from a goddamn communist!"\nJeane Kirkpatrick leaned forward, looking at the President. "Listen, Mister President," she began, "understand our position: our supporters and your supporters are totally distinct groups. We need a good reason to give our support to you."\nHarrington kicked back in his chair, eyeing the men and woman opposite him. "Well, what can I do?"\n"Resignation and suicide seem obvious choices," deadpanned Thurmond.\nKirkpatrick rolled her eyes. "A fully anti-Japan stance," she said, "Saber rattling, military funding; anything to piss off the Japs. That, and hold back on some of the more radical elements of your platform, like a universal basic income. That would probably calm down some of our voters."\nHarrington rubbed his eyes, sighing. There could be no victory without sacrifice, in the end. "Alright," he said, "I can work with that.""
 harrington.3.a:0 "Birds of Feather..."
 harrington.4.t:0 "Crossing the Aisle"
 harrington.4.desc:0 ""So, you're sure who you think it should be?"\n\nVice President Irving Howe stood idly across the Resolute Desk from Harrington, arms crossed. "You've asked me that several times already," he said, "my answer's the same: go with the Far Right. We're already radical enough in their eyes, if we don't at least make a gesture of getting along, the entire National Progressive Party might just collapse away into dust."\nHarrington sighed, "the more I ask you that the less confident I am that it's the right choice."\n"Then why ask me? Listen, Strom and Byrd would absolutely rally behind you if we-"\n"If we what?" Harrington interrupted, "If we gave up on our campaign promises, you mean. Even then, Byrd would be a hard sell, and Thurmond's not even worth trying."\n"Don't give up on him so easily," Howe replied, "he's a dog with no bite. Throw him a bone and he won't even bark."\n"The man said he'd 'sooner be in Tokyo with Tojo than in Hell with Harrington'. The Far Right- and Thurmond- are a no-go."\n"So," Howe began, "Republicans it is, then."\n"Republicans it is," agreed Harrington, reaching over to the phone. There was a meeting that needed to be called."
 harrington.4.a:0 "Francine? Get me a line to George McGovern."
 harrington.5.t:0 "A Foregone Conclusion"
 harrington.5.desc:0 "Michael Harrington sat at the head of the long meeting table. Exquisite mahogany, carved, and surrounded by what must have been a little over a baker's dozen of politicians he all knew by name. McGovern, Dole, Rumsfeld, McNamara, Gore, Rockefeller, Ford, and several others. "So, gentlemen," Harrington began, "I've brought you all here today because I believe we share common interests, and may work together for those interests. I am officially asking for the support of the Republican-Democratic party going forward. Our administration needs more support to pass its legislation through Congress, and I am of the belief that an agreement between our two parties may be reached."\n"So what do you want us to do?" replied George McGovern, "I'd be willing but I won't just blindly follow you."\n"Think of it more as a bipartisan agreement for the common good," said Harrington.\n"Absolutely not," interjected McNamara, "you really think our party would rally behind you? When I tell this to the Democrats in Congress it won't be pretty."\nDole was the next to speak, "hey, now, let's not be too hasty. Yes, the President here might have a few radical ideas but we could get some serious legislation passed with this alliance."\nSeveral murmurs of approval went up around the Republican side of the table, but the few Democrats remained silent until Donald Rumsfeld stood up. "Listen to yourselves! You'd rather break up the party for some progressive pipe dream than focus on what really matters? I won't add any more fuel to this fire. Goodbye."\nWith that, he stood and walked out of the room, followed by McNamara and an inconsequential senator whom Harrington couldn't remember the name of. "Let them go," said Bob Dole, "they'll come around sometime or another. Mister President, I'm all for this alliance. Despite your more radical policies, I have great respect for you and your dedication to the well being of America. However, I'm not so sure my compatriots have such convictions. Please, give us a few minutes to discuss this."\nHarrington obligingly left the room, checking his watch every minute or so. Two minutes, four minutes, seven minutes, nine. It went on and on and on until suddenly the conference room door gently opened, with the entourage of Republicans filing out. Bob Dole stopped and looked at the President, nodding gently."
 harrington.5.a:0 "A victory for progressivism."
 harrington.6.t:0 "Polarized"
 harrington.6.desc:0 "In recent weeks, several of the Far Right wing of the National Progressive Party have officially walked across the aisle and joined the Democratic Party. In addition, the Democrats have decidedly grown closer to the Far Right in response. It appears that this sudden, extreme action is in response to a conference held between leaders of the Republican-Democrat Party and the Harrington Administration, in which the Republicans and the President agreed to work together. The few Democrats invited to the meeting, including Robert McNamara and Donald Rumsfeld, quickly left after they claimed the President was not interested in making compromises.\n\nThe new alliance between the Republicans and the Progressives is already visible in Congress, with the two groups voting almost unanimously on their legislative proposals. A fiery speech given by Strom Thurmond in the most recent Senate vote showed just how far the NPP has split over this issue, with Thurmond calling the President a "traitor to the party". Despite the large political shakeup, and the new counter-alliance seemingly between the Far Right and the Democrats, it appears that most poor and middle class Americans are warming up to the Harrington Administration. The same however, cannot be said for their wealthier employers, who stand to lose millions from the President's social programs."
 harrington.6.a:0 "Geomagnetic Reversal."
 harrington.7.t:0 "Harrington People's Tour"
 harrington.7.desc:0 "President Harrington has become increasingly tired with the inflexibility of the Senate. Passing his reforms in the Congress turned to be a very difficult task, encountering the inflexibility of the conservatives and even the moderates. So he decided that instead of dealing with an increasingly hostile Congress he would go back to his roots. A tour across the country will be organized to talk to the common folk and listen to their problems. This will allow to create popular support for his Progressive agenda and improve his image among those communities more hostile to him.\n\nThe reactions to the so called People's Path were mixed. Progressives applauded the President's decision of staying true to his ideals of being the "People's President" and they hope this tour can gain sympathy for the progressive cause. Some moderates sympathetic to Harrington's program voiced their concern about the project, arguing that the President should stay in Washington to focus on passing his reforms and deal with other problems. Non-progressives were more critical about it, defining the entire thing as nothing but a vanity project. Some conservatives went so far as to call the tour an attempt to "create a socialist personality cult".\n\nHarrington ignored the critiques and focused on organizing his ambitious tour. After all, these people bothered to put him in the White House. Why not return the favor?"

 harrington.8.t:0 "Harrington Addresses the Poor"
 harrington.8.desc:0 "President Harrington made a stop at one of the many charity centers of New York City to address the poor and the helpless. Harrington felt confident in his ability to speak to the poor: all those years of activism on his youth weren't in vain. "Look, fellas. I'm not here to make a campaign or anything like that. There are no journalists, no photographers and not even bodyguards" Harrington wasn't entirely honest with that one: they were two members of the Secret Service infiltrated inside the crowd to avoid any lunatic doing something funny. "I'm not gonna tell you "vote for me" or any of that political crap. You tell me your names and I'm gonna sit on this chair and just listen to what you have to say."\n\nAt the exact moment that Harrington sat on the chair, a hundred hands raised up and the entire room filled with the voices of dozens of people. "One at the time, please" requested Harrington. A crippled man with a long beard went first: "I'm Jack. I lost a leg fighting the Nazis in Wales. They rewarded me by screwing my fucking pension. I've been homeless for ten years." Another woman with small children on her lap was next: "I'm Brenda. My landlord expelled me and my kids from my house. I don't know what do." Then, a young black man: "I'm Terry. I'm a drug addict in recovery. People refuse to hire me and call me names on the street. I feel like I can't change anything." Every single one of the seventy souls inside the room started to tell their stories for the next two hours.\n\nHarrington was out for words at first but he finally got up from the chair to deliver an answer. "This is outrageous. How can people suffer like this in the richest country on Earth? I'm gonna do everything I can to solve this and I'll resign in shame if I can't change anything!" The entire room cheered him, as Harrington thanked the people for his support. Local newspapers tracked the people on the meetings weeks later, reporting that their situations have improved a lot since then. President Harrington's approval ratings went through the roof in New York, with a similar result in other big urban centers."

 harrington.9.desc:0 "After leaving behind the big urban centers behind, Harrington wanted to address the middle classes to further push his progressive agenda. This stop in particular was particularly com: a community in Florida filled with conservative middle-aged people, a place where Harrington is really unpopular. The speech was nothing special with Harrington talking about the importance of helping fellow citizens, specially the poor. Some voices of disapproval could be heard when Harrington talked about the importance of everyone doing their part to end poverty as it was interpreted as an attempt to raise taxes. The interesting part came when Harrington announced that he would be taking questions from the crowd. His aides warned him that it was a risky strategy: if the discussion gets heated, the right-wing press was going to eat him alive.\n\nFortunately, Harrington was ready for that. The questions were mostly conservative talking points that he already heard a million times, so he had no problem answering then. However, the moment that most resonated from the event was the exchange that the President had with one person in particular. An elderly man wearing a cross-shaped necklace asked: "Why should I give my hard working money to lazy people that don't contribute anything to society, Mr President?"\n\nHarrington decided to make a gamble with his response. "I have noticed that you are a Christian, isn't it?" The man nodded proudly. "Well, while I admit I'm not a big religious person myself, I'm a bit familiar with Jesus's teachings. Didn't Jesus talked about the necessity of having compassion and pity for the poor? And knowing what he did with the merchants at the temple, I don't think he was very fond of the invisible hand of the free market." Harrington exclaimed. The reaction was mixed, with some outright booing the President but others laughing a bit. Conservative newspapers fiercely criticized the President for using Jesus to "push his heretic communist agenda", but the liberal media celebrated Harrington's witty comments on religion. The President is sure he made a good impression."

 harrington.10.desc:0 "Harrington's next stop on his People's Tour was the rural communities on the countryside. A good chunk of the rural farmers of the Rust Belt supported Harrington, so now he has to prove them that he is willing to support his campaign promises. Harrington addressed a group of corn farmers in Iowa to talk about the necessity of investing in the rural industry. He promised that more funding will be invested in subsiding the farms, improving infrastructure and creating new schools across the state. "Agriculture is one of the main cores of America, so it would an injustice to leave you behind just like that." In what was already a recurring trope for Harrington's tour, a voice could be heard from behind the crowd. "I voted for you and now my crops are fucked, you asshole."\n\nThe Secret Service was ready to push the troublemaker out of the crowd when Harrington ordered them to stop. "Do you want to come here to talk about it? Seriously, I'm interested" Harrington exclaimed. The farmer eventually arrived to the podium and the President asked what his problem was "Those rats just fucked my entire harvest and now I don't have a penny. What am I supposed to do?" Harrington thought about it for a few seconds and eventually delivered an answer. "Those who have the same problem right now, rise your hands" At least a third of the people present raised their hands. "Well, I didn't see the rat infestation coming, but that's not excuse. Not only am I going to invest in better pesticides, but also compensate those farmers that lose their crops. What do you think?" Harrington exclaimed extending his hand. The farmer smiled and shook Harrington's hand with satisfaction "That sounds like a pretty good deal!" The event made a really good impression on the rural regions, guaranteeing a solid support base for future reforms."

His objective is to ensure support for his ambitious program of expansion of funding for small and medium farmers. He managed to pressure some of the Governors of the Rust Belt to help him, but now he needs the support of the most powerful rural and manufacturer businessmen in the country. A reunion was planned in Washington to address the issue, where Harrington had to negotiate with his mortal enemies for hours.\n\nThe fat cats started to talk first. "With all due respect, Mr President your actions have greatly affected our interests" a man with a cigar exclaimed. "Your aggressive rhetoric only alienates our good will to negotiate. My associates and I want to make sure that this deal will be beneficial to us." another bald executive said. Harrington immediately fired back. "Gentlemen, this can end in two ways. We associate in this project, improving your profits and we both benefit from it or we do nothing, the farmers suffer and you lose your chance for a good business. I'm open to negotiation, but I also need your compromise." The executives were actually surprised that Harrington was willing to listen to their demands to come to an agreement. Maybe that pesky Socialist is not that dumb after all.\n\nAfter hours of negotiation and deliberating the details, the businessmen accepted moderate support for Harrington's project. "Well, Mr President my colleagues and I decided to support your project. We are confident that this partnership could benefit both parts. However, we also hope that you will respect our interests the same way we respect yours. Have a nice day." Harrington now needs to work on the bills, but after such a long tour through the country and dealing with the bourgeoisie he decided to take a few days to rest first."

 harrington.12.desc:0 "In recent weeks, dozens of Far Right politicians of the National Progressive Party have come out in support of President Michael Harrington, capped off today by Robert Byrd and Jeane Kirkpatrick announcing that the Far Right caucus is now standing fully behind the President and his policies. This comes as a surprising announcement to the nation, especially Far Right voters, who voted in strongly against the progressive candidate last November. Byrd himself even said that he would sooner join the Republicans than see Harrington- whom he called a communist- in office.\nNow however, the political situation appears to have shifted in favor of the Progressive Center, with the Far Right voting along in their most recent piece of legislation. Not all on the Far Right appear to have caved, with several Congressmen and politicians continuing to vehemently oppose the current administration. This group notably includes Senator Strom Thurmond, who had this to say: "I don't know what my party is doing, siding with a godless bolshevik like our current president. It saddens and angers me, and I will not give in to the tyranny of the majority; I will continue to fight for what's best for America."\nRegardless of the outliers, it appears that most of the Far Right wing is now cooperating with the Harrington Administration, and their voters appear likely to follow suit. How President Harrington was able to garner the support of a faction that has been strongly opposed to him in the past remains unknown, but a deal was likely made; one that may require the breaking of the President's campaign promises."

And everybody will be needed to mobilize voters, antagonize fence-sitting legislators, turn out to protest in favor of the administration, and help construct a coalition that the president can rely on.  Some will certainly find it distasteful, but the Harrington administration represents the best chance for radical material gain in the history of the American left.

Plenty of unions, spearheaded by the Reuther brothers' United Auto Workers, threw their whole weight behind the Harrington campaign.  But others, like the IBEW, UMWA, and SMWIA, all have leadership that is much more suspicious of the President.  Many of them have powerful machines that the NPP's political efforts rely upon, which they are loath to give up and which we would regret crossing.  \n\nThere are a number of ways we could deal with America's unions, but they pretty much boil down to two major options.  On one hand, we could bank on the UAW and other progressive unions to give us more of their support.  They're more ideologically aligned with us, and are more reliable, especially in the North, but there may be backlash from moderates elsewhere in the country, which could bode poorly for our future efforts.  On the other hand, we could reach out to more moderate unions, and calm their worries about our administration.  However, it's unlikely that we have the time or the political capital to address both."

The United Farm Workers had been harrying agriculture tycoons across the Southwest for years, and their brand of grassroots labor organizing appealed to the White House.  They would be valuable allies, if Harrington could convince them.  \n\nCesar Chavez's eyes never looked away from Harrington's.  Chavez looked kind and understanding, and he was, but he was weighing and balancing every word the president said.  Every now and again, he looked to Dolores Huerta, the master of outreach and organizing, gauging her expression.  They both heard the president say the right things, about what the DOJ and congressional allies could do, about how much he admired their efforts and principles.  He made commitments to investigate abuse and mismanagement.   \n\nAnd after two hours, Chavez and Huerta nodded."

The Centrist NPP legislators who form our base of support have generally been supportive, although we've received more than one exhortation to "be careful".  The Far Right, on the other hand, have been even more livid than usual.  They see it as a betrayal of the party, and of the principles that we all ostensibly share.  At least one of the staffers manning the phones in the West Wing has broken down in the bathroom after the third expletive-laced rant from a member of the Alabama congressional delegation.

He's a progressive, yes, but also one with a strong pro-war streak.  And he's a reliable, if occasionally critical, backer of the administration.  This makes him the perfect candidate for a congressional go-between.

Nevertheless, while hope pranced through the President's mind, the constant thoughts of a snake in the grass lied in the background. These thoughts persisted until the President's work was interrupted with some soft knocking at his door. Getting up to answer, President Harrington was greeted by Vice President Howe, who received a pat on the back from Harrington as he said "Irving, you surprised me!

Irving asked, before setting a manilla folder onto the President's desk. Harrington flipped open the folder to peer into the reports laid inside. Reports, graphics, and measurements, all of which showed another slither of what lies in the grass: former southern C-NPP members defecting to the Populist branch of the FR-NPP or even the Republicans. One paragraph noted that the words "chaotic" and "exhausting" had been one of the most common trends in phone polling in regards to the fitting words describing the Presidential administration according to the American public.\n\nThe reactions of the United States provided concern, but he knew this wasn't the end. "Well, nothing like a morning filled with reports of defection." Harrington said, rubbing his chin. "Well, Mike, you know one concrete fact as well as anyone after all these years: people don't like change. Like ripping the band-aid off a papercut, you know?" Irving said with a bit of a chuckle. Harrington sat back in his chair as he reviewed the reports again. "You know, us two have probably dealt with more papercuts than any of these people, what a way to throw a fit, right?" the President said, compelling the Vice President to offer a few more bits of laughter in regards to the happiness of the President.

Irving offered a smile and a handshake in return "Well, uh, Michael, another report came in about the defections in the South, a followup from the other day."

The numbers were accurate, as bases of his support continued to make moves towards joining the Republicans and the Far Right of the NPP. A bit of confusion filled him upon seeing a new growth of defections in the Rockies rather than the South.

Scenes of protestors gathering in the Rockies to combat his "aggressiveness" in changing the political atmosphere, with one group leader proclaiming that "the President has frustrated the government with his radical attempts to flip the table on them as he continuously butts head with the Congress to try to get these ridiculous proposals out.

Every word blended together to deliver a punch to the President's gut, as he watched the black and white television broadcast images of his foundation of support, the Midwest, his own homeland, Missouri, and the Pacific, acting in defiance with small gatherings looking to turn against his actions. Every demonstration, every showcasing of the American people's exhaustion with the conflicts in Washington, every banner, every sign, every action against President Harrington served to cut away at the strings of the President's heart.

He said in near monotone had Irving not caught the strings of emotions tied to the President's anguish. "Fuck." Harrington stated, pushing away from his desk as his face grew redder by the minute. "What the fuck else was I supposed to do, Howe, what the fuck else?" The President roused, making Irving more and more uncomfortable as he saw his friend descend into his anger. "I'm, I'm sorry, Irving. To imagine them being so tired as I sit here steering the course of the nation." He said. "Well, Mr. President, unfortunately, being tired and angry isn't going to solve the departure crisis we're seeing with members of the C-NPP, or the growth of the Yockeys across the South." Irving responded. "How bad is the party looking at this point?" Harrington asked. "Well, the South is already out of the question, every sympathetic man in the South has turned to the FR-NPP, the Democrats, or over to Yockey. The Rockies have slowed their defections, if for the only reason that there isn't any left on our side to switch over to the Republicans. Meanwhile, the very base of support you started out with, New England, the Pacific, and the Midwest are all turning over for the first time." Irving said. Harrington got up from his desk to pace around the Oval Office upon hearing the dreaded reports. "Mike, walking around the damn office isn't going to help stop Gus fucking Hall from taking all our support!" Irving barked. \n\nHarrington froze upon hearing his Vice President. Gus Hall? The leader of the L-NPP, who helped promote and start the protests, riots, and brawls through the city streets? Americans had already claimed that Harrington had broken apart the party; however, now he could only help but wonder if he had smashed the country in the process..."

 harrington.36.desc:0 "Harrington and Howe, some of the best friends found within the American political sphere, now found themselves once more silently across from one another in a mix of disgust and sorrow. In particular, Harrington had his eyes glued to the piece of paper that had made its way to his desk. A political cartoon, a source of humor for some active within the divided political world of the United States of America. For others, such as the United States, all he saw was scorn and insults as it depicted a gross misrepresentation of him taking money from blue collar white workers in the South and throwing it into a bonfire adorned with a sign marked "Welfare Program." \n\n"The daily newspaper in Mississippi seems to have taken a liking to you, Mr. President." Howe said. "What the hell did they do that for? I made these programs for them, Irving, for fucking them!" Harrington said, tightening the grip in his hands to vent his frustrations. "Easy, Mr. President. It's because Yockey's taking control across the South, and as the Far Right loses membership every day, Yockey burns your work across the South." Even as Harrington listened on, he had read the reports, he had watched the news, heard the people. Yockey may have been a bastard, that much is true; however, Hall was right on the other end of the spectrum, stealing away from the social democracy Harrington had built around himself to feed to his "proletarian" dreams. The NPP, the government, the whole damned country had been engulfed in this wildfire of partisanship and extremism. "Irving, I have a question." Harrington asked, in a tone mixed with resolve yet sorrow, as the Vice President braced himself. "Did I do all of this? Is it really my fault?" Harrington asked. Hearing the drastic question from the President, Howe took a long few minutes to think over the question. Howe knew that more than a superior, Harrington was his best friend. Someone who celebrated all their successes with him, and launched their platform into the spotlight. Someone who struggled with all their failures alongside him, and helped Irving get over all the obstacles they came up against. \n\n"Michael. It doesn't matter whether it's your fault or not. It doesn't matter if it really is your fault, and the federal government has become gridlocked by all the chaos coming from it. What matters is that we fix this, we repair what's been destroyed over the past few years." Irving said, patting his friend on the shoulder. "

 harrington.37.desc:0 "The static continued to eminante from the television sets as President Harrington looked on with anger, loss, and exhaustion. Just as the entire ordeal he had been put through for the past few months had exhausted him, the screams and cries of Americans across the country echoed a similar exhaustion. An exhaustion seemingly grew out of the peaceful change, stable economics, democracy, and logic that Harrington so desperately tried to forward under his Presidency. Rather, all that America could muster to show to the public was the hate inside their heads. \n\nWithin the South, hell had broken out by the name of Francis Parker Yockey. The seemingly compliant Far Right wing of the NPP dominating the South had been drawn, quartered, and cannibalized by the extremists marching across the streets, advocating for the support of Fascist influence to "undo the decadence found within the system of government within the Republic," as one rally leader proclaimed in Georgia. The bastards marched up and down roads, busy intersections, anywhere and everywhere they could find attention to, and brought havoc wherever they went, forcing the African-American populations of the United States into hiding. Even the madman himself had gone up to stage, with Yockey mounting a podium and advocating that they must "rescue the ideals of Western Civilization as it decayed with the growing disgust present in the world." \n\nMeanwhile, in the North, all who had remained to support Harrington were living in the shadow of a continuously growing name for the Progressives of the United States: Gus Hall. The Communist, seeking to dually overthrow the "shackles the United States' government binds to the American worker," as a news reporter within New York City had stated. Rallies displaying Communist propaganda through the streets of the industrial north brought together the suffering workers that, alongside the unmoving political figures of Washington, hadn't remained loyal to him after working so hard for them. The Progressives of the United States had become dominated by notions of extremism and anger, but even so, wasn't the rest of the country engulfed in the same fire? \n\nEverywhere President Harrington looked, he saw a nightmare of what was meant to be a country of freedoms. Now, radicals occupied the streets as blood, tears, and fire rocked the governmental system, with only the moving forward of time able to tell what lied ahead."

Exhaustion had turned to frustration, and with frustration came action, all until the cycle repeated until one thing was left to unite the spirits of the citizens of the United States of America. \n\nTerror. \n\nAcross the South, hardline Yockeyites had swelled in number, as they continued to ravage the notions of a free and diverse society within the United States. As their party members continued to march on in the name of Fascism, they left the streets adorned with smoke, broken glass, and blood. As the Far Right within the National Progressive Party, the former rivals for Harrington and all of the C-NPP, continued to die, a greater enemy seemed to take its place, a monster, no, an abomination. A beast of a man who sought to undo the hundreds of years of American history to raise Hell: Francis Parker Yockey. On the other hand, how could Harrington merely frame his dread around the South when the very supporters who chanted the name "Harrington" for the sake of progress now march the streets in a flood of red. The factory workers, the office writers, the hard-working American populace who had toiled for years at the behest of an unfair system attempting to strangle such poor souls out of their earnings, the ones who Harrington thought of and fought for within each and every day of his political career. Now, they cry displeasure and tiredness, and have labeled the President of the United States himself as being a "traitor to the movement of the working class." Gus Hall leads a political atrocity, one which stands to destroy the stability of the United States just as much as any figure harping the word of Yockey would as well, as he continues to tear apart the seams of political and economic foundation in the twisted name of "revolution." Now, America lies paralyzed, engulfed in the tide of destruction. Only time would tell what tragedy would strike the country next..."

But he hasn't abandoned his radical instincts, as a policy brief submitted today reveals.    It's a series of amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, boosting overall funding by nearly twenty percent, while adding a long set of funded activities.

None of the union representatives are particularly intimidating at first glance, but all of them hold the keys to one of America's biggest structures of power: education.  At one point, Jacqueline Vaughn, a Chicago union delegate with kind eyes and a spine of iron, raised her coffee cup in a toast.  \n\n"To President Harrington.  We of the Chicago Teachers' Union have no permanent enemies, and no permanent friends, but you're coming very close to the latter, sir."\n\nSmiles, chuckles, a smattering of applause.  But she meant it.  Ever since the passage of ESEA, with its major new extensions of funding and support, it's become clear that the teachers' unions of America are firmly in the Harrington camp.

Improved facilities, more funding for the arts and cultural histories... it escaped nobody's attention that these policies were first laid out in the Brisben proposal.\n\nClearly, the unions are looking for more, but getting them on our side will be easier said than done.  It might anger some of the party's conservatives, who have already raised a fuss about where, exactly, the ESEA's funds are going.

It does make sense; the government doesn't charge kindergartners for the privilege of attending their neighborhood school, after all.  Numerous progressives are clamoring for this policy change, to ensure that college placements are based on merit alone, and that no student should have to worry about tuition fees at a state school.

With each line came another comment from one or the other, and with each paragraph came another argument. Until finally, the elephant in the room came crashing down on the desk between them; the targeting and focus of the Food Stamp Program. \n\n"President Harrington, with all due respect, we need this bill to go above and beyond what the United States history has done for the hungry in the past! Supermarkets are exploding around the country, and it's common logic that offering Food Stamps to be used in such huge markets will guarantee that the poor and hungry can get something to eat, they need this, Mr. President! Besides, we ran on a campaign of guaranteeing these people food, we'll be the laughing stock of the National Progressive Party if we don't commit to this!" Secretary Freeman hammered out. "And what about those markets, Orville, do you think they'll feel righteous in handing out their profits to the needy? Mr. President, I assure you, I want these people to be fed as much as any, but forcing the free market to go too far may result in them firing back and withdrawing any sort of support for our re-election or even the NPP as a whole!

The President has reported that it took a "long, long time" to tweak the details and include everything that he and his administration desired to have in it. Harrington has claimed that "this Program is the foundation of a new era for American citizens, one in which mothers, fathers, veterans, and children will never have to fear with the looming question of 'Will I go hungry tonight, again?'"\n\nHaving said that, the Harrington administration has given its full backing behind the President.

Particularly, Orville Freeman, the Secretary of Agriculture who worked diligently with the program on other progressive reforms, comments, "Tonight, Congress will decide the fates of those lowly men, women, and children who lie on the streets, cold at night. Every unfortunate soul, scarred by the horrors of the Second World War, the plagues of economic difficulties, or otherwise, they will know if we, as a society, have learnt to care for such folk, or leave them in the dust as so many presidents have before." \n\nOnce more, however, not everyone is in favor of the President's actions; while some may call them "progressive," Republican-Democratic Congressman, as well as several of Harrinton's constituents in the National Progressive Party regard them as "simply radical."

 harrington.76.desc:0 ""The most radical policy yet put forward by the Harrington administration", as the New York Times put it.  Love it or hate it, that seems to be the consensus around Medicare.  The poor and working class have rallied around the bill, seeing it as a massive improvement for millions.  Unions in particular have been flexing their political muscles, pressuring NPP and Republican-Democrat legislators alike, through letter-writing campaigns and fundraisers.  On the other hand, the US Chamber of Commerce has taken the lead in opposing the bill.  They have their own letter-writing campaigns, and much more imposing fundraisers.  The Chamber has been calling Medicare the first step on the road to tyranny, a waste of money, a handout, and plenty of other things besides.  The sizable tax burden that's been plastered across the editorial pages of half the country's newspapers hasn't helped the administration's case much.  With both sides jockeying for Congress to vote their way, it's anyone's game, and the American healthcare system depends on how that vote goes."

All eyes stared wide towards the President, who seemed to be distracting himself to avoid the pressures of the room. With a cough, however, the man in the middle officially began the meeting. \n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin this by saying that I am proud of each and every one of you. Without every secretary present, our administration would be nowhere near as successful as it has been." A round of silence, with some awkward smiles, greeted the President. "Having said that, we are nowhere near finishing the work we have planned, in particular being the Social Security network we have planned out to guarantee every American the ability to feel secure about the financial matters of their lives. With that in mind, such provisions are not without costs, and we must address the elephant in the room: the Defense budget is easily one of the easiest programs of our expenditure to cut back on." \n\nThe President's proposal was met with a wide range of nervous coughs, gasps, and the shaking of heads. "With all due respect, Mr. President, the nation's security and safety is held up by the Defense budget, while we may desire the possibility of helping out those without stability, no one will have any form of stability if we're unsafe." Harrington nodded his head slowly, finally uttering, "Mrs. Neuberger, if you could please, what is taking up the majority of the United States budget?" All eyes swiftly turned to Maurine as she sat quietly, alone. \n\n"The Defense budget, sir."

harrington.87.t:0 "Double or...half?"
harrington.87.desc:0 "The entire West Wing of the White House was whirling with the sounds of phone calls and the rushing of executive interns and federal employees to aid everyone with their sudden rush of work to do. President Harrington, having just finished breakfast, was met with an employee rushing down the hall to get to the nearest Secretary when he asked the young man what was going on. "News got out about the potential rate of the rise of income taxes, sir." he said, giving the President a wave of anxiety. "Campaign donors and other business owners are having a fit, executive employees are taking a hit on all phone lines." He continued, rushing towards another office. \n\n"Damn it all!" Harrington said, making it back to his office while swiftly slamming the door on his way in with anger. He nearly fell down into his chair in the office, and pulled himself up to look at the sheets of legislation on his desk, and picking up his phone. "Secretary Neuberger, please come to my office immediately." Maurine soon walked in, with a swift "Please, take a seat." issued by her superior. "Maurine, now that the news is out regarding the income tax raise, we have to make a decision. If we sit on this we are just going to keep losing more support, should we go through with the full increase or not?" Secretary Neuberger was overwhelmed with the sudden demand of her, but managed to come together. "Well, Mr. President, I must admit that although it is quite the unpopular strategy, it would generate a substantial amount of income to come in for the Treasury. Furthermore, while I'm no campaign manager, people are sure to appreciate a Social Security net, and if taxes are to provide funds for it, then I would have to say that some would be appreciative at least." \n\nHarrington pinched the bridge of his nose to deal with the stress of it all. Neuberger was always one to provide legitimate facts, but he'd be damned to say that this would not come to make his next election a whole new pain in the ass. Having said that, maybe this is just what we need though, to rally those appreciative enough of it to his side to help with the Social Security program?"

harrington.91.desc:0 "It's a late night to be working in the Oval Office." President Harrington said, pacing around the room, jacket laid across his chair. At the same time though, he knew he could not rest. The construction of the bill was getting closer and closer to being ready, and yet, with every passing day, more memories of his earlier days flooded towards him. Constant thoughts about his political readings, his viewings of the suffering of those in labor, and the uncaring of their superiors towards their difficulties. No kidding why so many are hungry out there, can't even get a break to eat, can they? Harrington dwelled on his thoughts, and finally sat down after the hour of time he had to battle with himself. Finally, he grabbed the phone, and punched in that ever familiar number. "Mr. President? It's eight in the evening, can I help you?" Secretary Neuberger replied over the phone. "Listen, it's about the Social Security bill. I think I finally want to add in the amendments to the Fair Labor act in it, could you come in?" Silence came in through the phone for a few moments. \n\nGive me half an hour to get there, Mr. President. \n\nThe President's Secretary came in through the Oval Office just a minute early. "You don't joke around with time, do you?" Harrington said. "Mr. President, I appreciate your humor, but this could completely change the situation. Adding those amendments could cause the business owners to lash out far worse than ever before, and we are already taking in deep crap from them, what makes you think giving them more hell is going to do for us?" With that, the Secretary's respectful disposition faded to the back, as Harrington thoughtfully nodded. "Madam Secretary, my senior communications advisors have instructed the danger in it, that the bill is already facing the threat of death without the amendments. But let's face facts, Mrs. Neuberger. Every day, those hard-working Americans that we are trying to look after up here are not getting any respect for the work they do, nor any way to move forward from their suffering. We need to help them! \n\n"But is it the right time? The bill could die the second it hits the Congressional vote already. " Harrington thought, in the midst of silence."

harrington.92.desc:0 "President Michael Harrington and his administration have unfailingly worked through the difficulties of executive ties to legislation, as they have finally forwarded a landmark bill that seeks to completely revolutionize current standards of welfare within the United States. Harrington has brought up the disastrous effects of economic recession before, and remarked that "the guarantee of a Social Safety economic network could provide unheard of success for the American citizen, and bring forth a new era of prosperity and care for the public sector, with workers and business owners alike being able to benefit from the program's successes." \n\nWith that in mind, many White House executives have exhaustedly doled out their support for the President's bold actions lately, in particular, Secretary Maurine Neuberger has offered extensive work in lessening fears regarding the bill. "Seeing President Harrington every day, I know that this piece of legislation is something that comes from deep within him. To see the success of American citizens without a cost to their freedom, time, or effort. He believes in the American Dream, and just knows that it takes a great amount of care and unity to see that we may prosper together." \n\nWhile Secretary Neuberger's words indeed spark emotion, the opposition cite a lack of any form of unity in the bill. Many of Harrington's critics, including several Democratic Senators, cite that such a program will bankrupt American reserves, while a wide range of far right Congressmen in the National Progressive Party see this as a "direct violation of American economic traditions." No one is quite sure as to the chance of success for President Harrington's bill, but emotions are high with everyone present."

Vice President Irving Howe said. "We get the people supportive of our reforms, the less opposition the R-D's will be able to put up." \n\nHarrington nodded. It wasn't rocket science - he'd promised America a presidency of the common man, and he would keep his promises. The only question was where to start. \n\n"What about the veterans?" Defense Secretary William Winter stated. "America has thousands of men who served in South Africa and in the Pacific. Nobody's going to object to us treating our heroes right." \n\n"A Home for Heroes." Nobody would question the need to repay America's soldiers for their service; the far right of the NPP would be ecstatic, and the R-Ds would be hard-pressed to say no. And if the veterans got a fair deal from the government, then the people might come around to being included eventually."

Approval in hand, his army of aides scattered out of the Oval Office to carry the draft to Henry Jackson in the Senate and to other key lawmakers in Washington. \n\nOutside the White House, the night grew darker as the clock chimed midnight. Harrington rubbed his eyes, dry from the strain of reading through the draft. He'd taken a close look at every line - this first act, the one upon which everything else would follow, would be perfect. Senator Jackson would ensure that the rest of the draft would go through Congress, to take care of the rest. \n\nIt ought to be easy, Harrington thought. Everybody loved veterans, and the NPP could finally stick it to the R-Ds for not only being soft on the fascists, but ungrateful to its soldiers. Education subsidies for veterans, increased access to healthcare, disability payments to the injured - who in their right mind could oppose this? \n\nHarrington sighed. It'd been an exhausting night regardless, and it would only get harder from here."

harrington.95.desc:0 "The news from the Senate floor was largely encouraging, if the floor speeches were any indication. As Defense Secretary Winter had pointed out, nobody was going to be so gauche as to criticize a bill to treat America's veterans well. The Center and the Far-Right of the NPP were broadly in support, and mounting a full-throated defense of the bill. The R-D's, for that matter, were speaking in broad platitudes about the bill's provisions, hailing the intent of the legislation. \n\nBut the details were a different question. Time and again, Democratic senators - and even a few Republicans - had asked about money. Money, money, always the money. Harrington had been in Washington long enough to understand that when people wanted to criticize you quietly, they would ask about the money - a fitting fig leaf to disguise a lack of concern for America's soldiers in the language of responsibility. \n\nThe debate wound on, and Harrington resisted the urge to call the Senate leadership for an update. Politics was a numbers game, of course, but they'd been careful to package everything in a way that couldn't be opposed on the merits. There'd been endless whip counts, fine-tuning of individual clauses, hypothetical debates. Harrington's NPP had left nothing to chance..."

I was working at Los Angeles County General Hospital, but they changed the name a few years back.  Anyway.  The man's name was John.  A cab driver had found him collapsed a few blocks away from the hospital.  A few minutes after we had brought him in and put him up in a bed, he pulled a switchblade and was holding it against my throat.  It turns out that he didn't have a cent to his name, and couldn't pay for services.  Guess he thought taking a hostage would help his situation somewhat.  We let him go, and I never saw John again.  The police shrugged it off, when they finally showed up.  Just another homeless wino, they said.  Would probably turn up dead in a week, they said.\n\nWhen I saw that Medicare had passed, I thought about John.  Working as a nurse, you see a lot of people's worries.  I saw John's that night.

Eventually, I became the only person in my family to graduate high school.\n\nI wanted to go to college intensely.  But at Husson, the entrance test was in English, and I was terrible with it.  So I went to my state representative, Peter Snowe, and he helped convince the admissions people to let me take a test in French.  I passed, and they accepted me.  Now, I'm studying for a business degree.  I write for the school newspaper.  And thanks to the Higher Education Act, I don't have to worry about the cost.

My parents never spoke it around me, although my cousin works at a school in Zuni Pueblo that teaches it to little kids.  I hope to send mine there someday.  When I was growing up in Gallup, though, my parents didn't spend much time caring about school.  My father was a dishwasher, and my mother a hotel maid.  The highways were being built, and with them came travelers, tourists, all of those people.  It brought money and jobs, but nobody got rich.  Not even close.  My parents drank.  They never did drugs, but most of my friends had at least one parent who did.  We were all desperate.  Once I left home, I moved across town with the boy I'd met at Gallup High.

 harrington.201.desc:0 "President Harrington sometimes takes a walk along the grounds of the White House: in the first weeks of his term he made the bold move to begin walking around the D.C. Metropolitan Area's seedier districts, the streets that the Secret Service make sure to lock down every Presidential Address. He continues that tradition on an infrequent basis, when he can spare the time, greeting the lower-income constituents of the Beltway and treating them to a meal - he takes pains to remember all their names. Sometimes the name is all you have, he thinks. In any case, Harrington has little fear of blowback from these men and women: his policies have shifted the window on public discourse and treatment of the poor more than any other president in American history. Although he has savaged his Cabinet, nearly driven the Chambers insane and generally raised hell to do so, he has no regrets on the matter.\n\nTonight he takes a slightly different route, walking in another direction: same streets, different people. The lights dim, the streets narrow and fill with the casual refuse of American life, broken condoms and filled trash-bags. The other America is here, where the normal Americans aren't, and their response will tell him more about his success as a President than any pundit or analytical group. He walks into a cafe, its dull neon aesthetic glinting in the streetlights, and begins to probe. Is the government doing okay? Do you feel safe? Do your children feel safe? What do you think? "The fridges are still empty most days, the schools aren't working thanks to all the new fancy rules, the kids still walk to school afraid. But I hear it's worse in Mississippi. I hear it's worse in the Black Belt. I hear it's worse in Detroit.

Simply put, the average National Progressive is a schizophrenic, his disparate personalities united only by a hatred of the Japanese threat. Many were willing to band around the cause of pushing the weak, spineless Republican-Democrats out of the White House. But the tension could only be ignored so long - and now it is beginning to splinter the very ground under which the President sits.\n\nAs Harrington's presidency becomes increasingly focused on its internal policymaking, and the cries of Big Government grow ever louder from the street-tops, the NPP is beginning to reconsider its loyalty to the man it has propelled to office. If a candidate refuses to toe to party line, bullying his party-members into submission and pushing an agenda that appears increasingly radical, well.. Loyalty can be defined, but it can also be redefined - created, but also withheld. The Rightists in the NPP led this charge, attempting to negotiate with Harrington to tone down his radical interventionist policy, but to no avail.\n\nIn a series of closed-door meetings the inevitable comes to pass. The Far Right-NPP moves across the proverbial floor, denouncing the Harrington Presidency as a nest of traitors, snakes and vipers dedicated only to turning America decadent, weak and prey for the foreign invaders. They are accompanied, alarmingly, by a pronouncement from a series of Baptist churches in the American South and West, declaring much the same thing: but this time they go further. For the first time in American civic history, a pastor declares the incumbent American President an Anti-Christ, dedicated to giving the American way of life over to the devil. This is an unpleasant surprise: it will not, however, be the last."

 harrington.203.t:0 "Doubt In The Aisles, Fear In The Pews"
 harrington.203.desc:0 "The editorial is simple and damning: President Harrington is going too far. His policies are well-intentioned, no doubt - here the author pauses for dramatic effect, evaluating Harrington's personal history and his party's policies in an objective light - but are they really what is best for Americans at this point in time? Harrington's reformist sentiments extend not just to pension funds and social safety nets, but to education, to urban design, to the structure of the job, to a hundred other things that define the American way of life. How much can the apple tree be shaken for its fruits before the trunk tears itself apart in the tension? The author goes on to note that the worrying lack of progress on many of Harrington's Moral Battlefields, his areas of focus where the American poor are concerned, does not reflect a lack of effort on the Administration's part. The bureaucrats of the American government are simply trying to barricade policy they see as alienating and dangerous, not to mention tedious. They might even be right.\n\nThe sympathy the author exudes is possibly the most insulting thing about the article: it is clear that in other circumstances, the author might even have supported Harrington for his conviction and unshakeable belief in the need for a government with a heart. It is with profound sorrow that the author announces his doubt, so profound it acts as a final spit in the metaphorical coffin. He pronounces, with a magisterial and terribly condescending grace, that Harrington is 'the President we deserve, but perhaps not the President the nation needs right now.' Perhaps the editorial would not be so damning, nor its effect so profound, if it were not for the name attached to it: the editorial is written in the unmistakable style of, and signed off by, Lyndon B. Johnson, staunch Republican, cold-eyed reformist and (until today) the biggest ally Harrington has across the aisle policy-wise. If the Johnson is wavering, then Harrington's cross-aisle support is under threat as well: and another card is taken out of the already trembling house."

Long-time enmity dissolves to wistfulness and sorrow, and the hopes undergirding that enmity are sublimed into a greater regret - it is said that things are most beautiful in retrospect, and perhaps the main engine driving that beauty is not the joy those things brought, but the sorrow of having to leave them behind. So it is in a quiet room in the locked doors of a hotel a few miles from D.C., as a long-time partnership dissolves - this partnership is not a matrimonial one, but it brings with it its own emotional baggage, and a fear of the future, that would not look out of place in any family court.\n\nThe Republican faction has officially renounced its support for Harrington's policy and by extension his administration: LBJ himself has spoken to the press about the mounting and eventually unbearable tensions the President has wrought on his nation through misguided and hasty policymaking. In a defiant shot back across the aisle, the President has in turn accused Lyndon of being the worst of allies, a moderate too enamoured of the vested interests he hides behind his back to support real change. The answer is clear: a break in public must be followed with a split in the alliance which once held Harrington's Congress together, and helped push through most of his policies.\n\nThe parting of longtime partners is always bitter, and tinged with sorrow: but the uncertainty is far more visceral than either of these. Harrington wonders, as he walks out of that hotel room into the bright day of the Beltway, what lies ahead for the country, and for himself. The ground trembles and quakes, but there is no time to stop. The programme, after all, must be finished - for Harrington has bright dreams for his country still, and the most dangerous visions are those that remain untarnished in the face of failure."

Progressivism is a potent motivator, but its unifying power has always been in doubt, and within the C-NPP there have always been strains of divergent thought about the extent and importance of the reforms officially proposed under their platform. Harrington's newfound aggressive stance is one that has shaken significant parts of this unstable base: talking about Social Security and reforms to labor security are quite different from what has been accomplished, what has been done and what remains on the table. There is talk of radicalism, of overreach - the Good Old Days are definitely gone, as are the smiles that accompanied it.\n\nBobby Kennedy sums it up best: in a speech given at Party Headquarters (publicised by media after the event in lurid fonts) he comments on "the devil we know, and how he turned out to be the devil we don't know so well after all". The reference doesn't even bother with explicitness, which in itself stands as a testimony to the splits occurring within the Progressive front. It's all out in the open now, and so when Harrington hits back with a demand for party unity and a call to "stay on course, lest we drift apart and then astray", no-one is surprised. Acrimony is the order of the day, after all, and just as with any breaking family, it might even be taken as a sign of affection.\n\nOne thing is certain: if things go on like this, well... the President is a strong man and no one can say he is a coward, but he is not a miracle worker. Lapsed Catholicism aside, no Savior will descend on fiery clouds to help him where even his own party has deserted him.

Nobody smiles, few greet the President, many outright argue with him.

The Rightists are long gone, the Republicans have left, the Progressives have crumbled, the radicals are increasingly silent (although a Representative Yockey and his followers are vocal in their agitation). Slow amputation, but an amputation nonetheless.\n\nThe Republican-Democrats can only watch in awe as their biggest rival for the hearts of the American people calves and splinters from within, unsure whether to mourn or celebrate. The cliques are forming, along lines carefully predetermined by alignment on policy platforms and collaboration: the only thing they can think to agree on is that none of them will ever work with Harrington's Men Of The People (or Yes-Men, to use the derogatory term) again.

Chavez himself has begun to take on an increasingly accommodating position, speaking up for the use of Presidential executive orders where legislative means prove non-viable (and since President Harrington doesn't control Congress, the former is looking like an increasingly appeal long option).\n\nCertainly there are very few cynics left in the Cabinet, and even fewer remain in the President's graces: in what appears to be a reactive fit of paranoia the President has even begun expelling those he seems unfit for the Party and an enemy of his agenda from his personal space (although he really doesn't control much beyond his personal desk anymore). Those who are left are forced to withstand an environment of constant stress and fatigue. Too much work, too few hands, and the cameras and paparazzi grow louder every day, their chorus more insistent.\n\nAfter a 25-hour board meeting titled Resolution To Current Affairs (Legislative Means And Procedures), Harrington reportedly collapses from stress and overwork at a conference reviewing the continuing failures of Education Reform in the Southern states.

(Last week the papers published a photo of a Guardsman wrestling with a protestor: it was bad optics for all, and if the Zhdanov cocktail in the protestor's hand had been dropped...)\n\nThe hooded figure making his way down the alley gazes at the signs, the paint still drying in bright flecks and stripes: HARRINGTON GET OUT! COMMUNISM NOT WELCOME HERE! WHO PAYS FOR US? The crowds holding it aloft are not Bankers or corporate suits, of course. No, these crowds are the middle and lower classes: from the West Coast drawls and the New England polish he hears in the babble, some of them have come quite a long way. He listens attentively, asking questions: here at the end of all things he can at least ask for clarity.\n\nThe poor speak to him as they never have before. Collapsed companies, drying-out towns and burnt-out Teachers, slowly slumping local economies. Reforms to education impacting thousands of students, some of them poor, some of them their families' last hopes. Broken homes that only receive a perfunctory brush with federal welfare, and are left to rot. Whispers of the President's inaction towards certain parts of the civil rights movement - is he a bigot? And regret, regret for President Harrington and for the nation he dragged into the furnace of good intentions, endless regret and the scent of lost futures.\n\nAll these come out into the open, and revelation brings its own senseless and ineffable calm. That night the hooded figure slips back into the White House, sleepless once again, and closes his eyes."

 harrington.301.desc:0 ""My fellow Americans, I am humbled to accept the decision of our great Country this night; the Bible on which I will swear an oath this January behoves me to serve you all as equals, rich, poor, black, white, country folk or urbanite. But looking at the crowd here with me, as I speak, reminds me that much remains to be done in the task of making America a place where we are all truly free.\n\n"I will be frank: I was not elected as a compromise, nor will I act as if I were bound by the chains which strangled Nixon and others before him. My position gives power, but it also bestows vision. I see the tired young mother, struggling at her workplace against the invisible sexism that chokes her career and her family; I see the tired old farmer, yoked to the agriculture companies that rob him of his due share. I see the fearful young Negro walking on the city streets, knowing his every breath is a threat to those who would seek his harm. Their struggle to live, work and play is my struggle as well, and I will make it our struggle; for if the other America dies a quiet death just off the television screen, I, your President, will have failed at leading this one. And the struggle that defines these forgotten ones is not just one of poverty, but of culture, soul and spirit; therefore it will be my task, and my privilege, to bring true and lasting reform to the system which shackles with crime, unemployment, despair and low health. I implore all Americans to stand with me, and with them.\n\n"...My fellow Americans, my party and my country pledge me to protect the Union indivisible. Help me save the Union invisible - the hungry, tired, poor, those yearning to breathe free. For if we do not lift our lamp besides this golden door we are given, and beckon them in, we do not deserve either.\n\n"Thank you, goodnight, and God bless America - with liberty and justice for all.""

Called our own Dixie Clique and reactionary wing "snakes in the damned grass" and (REDACTED FOR SENSITIVE CONTENT). Asked for those with "a heart for the working man" to join Party Centre grassroots movements and organize. (note: how do we move to organising our own rallies without the Party Right knowing? Check with grassroots organizers this month.)\n\nMeeting with Senate - POTUS declared "a new morning in America", gave speech on the "'modern day slavery of entrenched interests" and declared intention to "destroy the political chicanery holding this country back". Much booing from expected opponents: RepDem and our own conservatives. (Profiles of notable opponents attached for later use.) Party Left gave expected levels of support, although news from the vine suggests some caution from the radicals.

 harrington.303.desc:0 "From the memoirs of Edward Michael Harrington Jr:\n\n...it had come to me, in my scattered thoughts in that busy newspaper hall in New York all those years ago, that my God was quiescent if not outright non-existent. But my faith in the essential worth, the dignity and pride of man, that which is granted to each of us at birth and which the world cannot wrest away save through death - that faith could no more leave me than I could choose to leave my bones and skin. Hence I pursued a singular goal once in office, most peculiar to my peers and aggravating to my opponents; the return to an honest American morality in policymaking, away from the gilded sham it had become in the hands of capital. I began my third speech to Congress with this story:\n\n"Any child will tell you, and proudly at that, that if one were to see a starving beggar at the side of the road, the right, Christlike, American thing to do would be to help him up, bring him home, treat his wounds. Indeed, if the child were to recommend that we leave him at the roadside to live or die, any parent would rebuke him! The desire to protect the commonweal is ingrained in the nature of man itself. Yet because our country's business halls and public offices deem poverty a sin and helplessness an untreatable illness, we have all become hypocrites! We rob the beggar of his right to healthcare and safety, the mental patient of his right to equal and proper treatment, and the criminal of his right to redemption and restoration to the world."\n\nMy question, friends, is this: when your children grow old enough to see you as an equal, to know your accomplishments for what they are, will they call you a hypocrite too? Someone who knew his duty to his fellow man, but spurned it because he was weak, afraid, or simply had too much to lose?...And that terrible title of hypocrite; will you deserve it?"

With his head so far into the clouds, the President hardly heard the knock at the door he should have been expecting. "Come in," he said, snapping out of his trance.\nIn walked an older, slender man with deeply greyed dark hair. Harrington had been expecting Glen H. Taylor, having called him only a few days ago, and now he had finally arrived. "Mister President," he said, sitting down across from Harrington, "I understand from your call that you're looking for me as a cabinet member?"\n"That's right, Taylor. A President needs a cabinet, and I've dallied for too long on the formation of mine. I want you to be my Secretary of State."\nTaylor looked taken aback. "Really? You want me to be your Secretary of State? I just don't know; I was a politician for only a few years back in the '50s, and now I'm just a middling activist and businessman. Why me?"\n"During your tenure as a Senator, you put up some of the most fierce opposition to the far right that I've ever seen. You're determined, hardworking, and educated. I need people like that in this administration. I need people like you."\nTaylor sighed, rubbing his chin in contemplation.

Would like anything? Coffee? I've got some freshly brewed."\nHe needn't have said anything about the coffee; Harrington could smell the roasted, bitter flavor from just outside the door. He must have made it in anticipation. A thank-you, most likely, for choosing him. She was on to him; he had never said anything about a cabinet position over the phone. "I'd like a cup, yes," he finally said, "with sugar, but no cream."\nShe obliged him, returning with a delightfully sweet but decidedly dark cup of liquid. "It's very clear to me that you know why I'm here," said Harrington.\n"Indeed," she replied, "so, what position do you want me for?"\n"Secretary of the Treasury."\nNeuberger raised an eyebrow. "Treasury? Well, I suppose that is what I would be most qualified for."\n"You're intelligent, respected, and you won't back down a fight with Wall Street or any other business interests because yours don't align with theirs.

That can't give away much about my intentions, right?"\n"Respectfully, sir, a Lieutenant Governor does not typically engage in meetings with the President of the United States. If you wanted to see me in person, it would be for something important. So, what do you want me for?"\n"Secretary of Defense."\nWithout missing a beat, Winter replied, "Of course, I accept. I figured that's why you were here so I've had some time to mull it over in my head, but, tell me, why not someone more experienced? I only reached Lieutenant Colonel, and even then I never saw much combat."\n"True, but you got that rank for something. Plus, you won Lieutenant Governor as a progressive Democrat in the most southern, hard conservative state that there is. You're a leader; you inspire people. That's got to count for something.""

Although the [GetLeader] Administration has remained tight-lipped on concrete initiatives, this has only encouraged the imagination of the political class in Washington. Members of the NPP congressional delegation could be heard throughout the week speculating on America's newfound foreign policy, ranging from doubling military and financial aid to the Organization of Free Nations to actively destabilizing the Co-Prosperity Sphere's via its many restive insurgencies. While stressing that the ultimate decision rests with the President, senior NPP figures emphasized that 'all options remain on the table.' \n\nMembers of the Republican-Democratic Party have expressed skepticism towards the President's confrontational foreign policy, viewing the endeavor as naive adventurism. A senior R-D policy aide, who asked not to be named, panned the NPP policy as dangerously reckless with little consideration for de-escalation.

"Total military superiority has to be the foundation of our strategy. The Japanese only respect force, and we'll beat them at their own game."\n\nAs the Chairman finished, the Secretary of State shot him a withering look. "That's bullshit. Hoarding resources is meaningless if the Japanese isolate Australia and New Zealand to wither and starve. We have to fortify and invest in the OFN, an unbreakable rock for the Japanese to break themselves upon."\n\nThe Director of the CIA sighed. "The Japanese Empire is not the monolith they make themselves out to be. Political subversion and precise covert action can expose the rot at the heart of their Empire, eroding it from within."\n\nWhen the three finished, President [USA.GetLeader] digested their proposals.

It was, for many officers, the safer option: the worst they could expect to face were battles with street gangs, rather than the endless jungle ambushes of the Army. \n\nAnd yet, for the first time in years, the populace was increasingly uncooperative. Wary glances and resentful stares, once reserved for the Army officers, now followed policemen on their daily patrols.

"How many more of you are there?" Slap. "Where are your comrades hiding?" A vacant smile; the lieutenant slammed the butt of his rifle into the insurgent's sternum. The insurgent, face wracked with pain, vomited a black soup of blood and pus, before sucking in one last ragged breath. \n\n"Viva la revolucion," the insurgent croaked, doubling over with his final words."

They were superbly organized, running a parallel government in plain sight of the Japanese - a promising sign.\n\nOne morning, the captain took Cayetano aside. "Somebody wants to talk to you. Tonight, stay in the bar past closing. You'll be back in a few days." \n\nIt was the break he'd been waiting for, and Cayetano eagerly hung on after the bar's lights went out, until the hood came over his head and the chloroform swept him away from consciousness. A few times, he could hear the muffled roar of an engine, the bumps of a backroad passing underneath. By the time his eyes could focus again, he found himself bound in a wooden hut, sunlight filtering through the cracks in the wall. \n\n"So, you're finally back."

As the Cabinet drafted the outline of America's industrial strategy to support any future war with Japan, two distinct schools of thought had emerged. \n\nOne, championed by the Secretary of Defense, advocates for the expansion of military infrastructure and production capacity. The legacy of President Joseph Kennedy's failure to build up America's military continues to haunt the Pentagon; proponents of this plan argue that the buildup of military equipment needed to support a future war must start today, even at the expense of other industrial or economic priorities. They warn that ultimately, America will go to war with the military it has, rather than the military it wants. \n\nThe Secretary of Commerce takes a different tack, arguing that fostering the growth of America's civilian industrial base would yield accelerating dividends in the longer-run. The wholesale diversion of American industry into military production, they argue, would be monstrously inefficient and create a hypermilitarized economy like that of Germany or Japan, a nation of free men enslaved to their guns. Even if it would take time to shift civilian factories to military production in a crisis, America remains protected by the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, buying time to bring American industry to bear."

This could make for good optics, given our past... issues with Guyana. Let us issue an official statement about how touched we were by the story and promise a nice fat foreign aid package for the Guyanese government, to be invested into integrating the countryside into the modern industrial economy. That should win us some hearts and minds."

The CIA recommends targeting the "soft underbelly of the Sphere," the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

However, for many others we appeared as cowards who abandoned them to Japan at best, and as little better than the Japanese at worst. Many of the older fighters fought against our own troops once upon a time, and though only the most ancient of the members remember the Spanish, many of the Filipinos saw our actions during and after that war as naked imperialist aggression. Luckily, our effectiveness in sabotaging the Japanese and the enthusiasm of the other resistance movements in the regions have convinced the larger Filipino resistance groups to finally meet with us and discuss how we can help them in liberating their country.

Let us emulate this success by bringing key Asian resistance figures stateside for intensive training, so they can return to their home countries with knowledge of the most modern drill, combat and sabotage training procedures available in the greatest country in the world.

While key government officials like the President were evacuated to Australia during the collapse of our army there at the start of the war, many more junior ministers and civil servants of the Commonwealth remained trapped in Luzon. Many of them were released or outright ignored by the Japanese during the war, but in the wake of the Akagi Accords, many of them disappeared, which we thought was due to a purge by the Laurel administration. However, now it seems that dozens of them were warned of the incoming purge and were evacuated by the Luzon-based Hunters ROTC guerilla group to rural Mindanao. On the basis of the former cadets of the Hunters and surviving Army remnants, they formed the Provisional Government of the Army of Mindanao (PGAM). If we can reconnect them with the old exile government in DC, we have a real shot at restoring a legitimate alternative to the collaborationist regime! Their territory is tiny and their fighters fewer than four digits, but combining their small sliver of freedom with the legitimacy of the old regime will prove a powerful symbol.

The match we threw helped ignite the explosion of violence against injustice in Indonesia, and now we can sense something big on the horizon, the true end of the hegemony of the setting Sun. It may take us years or even decades to get there, but America will not rest until the Japanese clutch is broken and Asia is free for the first time since the colonial era began.

He knew every bump, every stop, every turn on the roads that led him to the place where he had celebrated his greatest triumphs and dealt with his most devastating defeats. As the guards gave their familiar salute towards the presidential convoy going into the complex, he remained lost in thought, desperately trying to push away what he had come here to do and instead focus on the memories he had made there before. Like that night Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, after having to move heaven and earth to finally deliver the promises of America to so many, and had fallen asleep beside him open bottle of champagne in hand.\n\nThose feelings of warmth were the only thing that powered him to get out of the car and walk over to the calling flame, but even they couldn't defeat the sense of finality that washed over him as he stopped and finally looked towards where his brother rested. All he could do was simply stare and shiver as the memories of fortitude were replaced by ones involving Jack, long pushed down by both repression and the strains of governance. The ferociousness of Hyannis touch football, the giddiness of him winning the VP nomination, the glow of undying loyalty as his Chief of Staff... He wasn't his charismatic, secure self anymore, and with all his remaining strength he took the note he had held in his clenched fist and laid it down next to the dancing flame. He stared at it, as the feelings of utmost anger, sadness, and loss died down inside of him, before abruptly walking back to the limo. Not a word was uttered by the Secret Service as he grasped onto Ethel, as memories of old faded away and the realization that he had finally made his family's legacy whole set in. After years of fighting, scraping, and clawing, he had secured what his brother had died for, what he had fought for every single day since that horrible moment. Tears poured down his cheeks as the limousine drew away, and he said goodbye to Arlington for the last time.\n\nDusk fell. An elderly groundskeeper shuffled between the rows of headstones, tidying them, making sure they would look perfect to the families who would come through those gates in the morning. Checking on the Eternal Flame, he saw a piece of paper. He picked it up, unfolded it, and pondered the words of a grieving brother's soul finally at peace."

Yes, it may take time and money to get there, but America will soon be rid of the extremists who pull and tear at the seams of the constitution, and be able to walk forward with the power of the military at her fingertips, and a well-off American populace standing their to support her in all she does.

This cannot do, this will not do, for we are America, We the People, for the People!

Surprising? No, for President Jackson had known the chill of frost since his birth as a Washingtonian along the West Coast of the United States. Enlightening? Of course, as Jackson dwelled upon the sources of belief and ideas that had spawned throughout his life, from birth to his swearing upon the Bible.\n\nSure, when you look at the America of today, you can see all the scars of pushing and pulling from partisan politics, of course. But beneath all of that, it was the poor African-American he drove past through the city of Everett, who constantly shivered from frost by any other name, just as frigid. It was the veterans and soldiers he shook hands with, talking about the stories of desperation and the fight for their country they endured as they fought through the Second World War in the Pacific and in England, or, for the younger ones, the plains and savannas of Africa. Hope was what inspired him, as he knew it was possible for this amazing country to be helped even more, no matter how many soldiers or dollars it took. Dollars were what fed the hungry, clothed the naked, cared for the sick, and sheltered the homeless, while soldiers were what stood the wall for America on the frontlines, and made sure the fascists out there didn't take one more goddamn step forward.\n\nA car's lights passing by the wet morning's dew shook the President back to reality, as his hands grasped his mug of coffee, bringing it to his lips. America needed help, to be sure. But it's core was golden, and it's time for him to take a stand and ask what he can do for this country. After all, he knew he was the man to do it."

Now, I want you all to know something: in recognizing the greatness of your state and of all Kentuckians within, your state motto comes to mind: 'United We Stand, Divided We Fall.' Now, the very power of the statement calls to mind some of the fights this country has been having within itself; however, I swear upon here and now, that this country is as great as it ever has been, even if it may need your help. That is why I call upon the Bluegrass State's help in moving forward, in helping pick up those who've fallen down on their luck in this country, so that everyone is ready and able to bring about a newer and brighter day for the United States of America! I understand some have raised criticisms and concerns for the cost and whatnot, but mark me, Kentucky: it is our duty, both civil and moral, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your fellow American, and the only way we can guarantee this is by helping those who lay suffering, no matter the cost!"\n\nThe rest of the night was consumed with a mix of glamor and promises, as far as Vice President McMath was concerned.

So, we gotta show them what we stand for: everything that gets done in this room, every decision made, every hand shook, every thought that passes through our mind, it all has to back one principle: Evil must, and will, be met with force. There's no room for detente when the people we have to work with have butchered and beheaded the fathers and grandfathers of the families of Americans out there, and there's no way in Hell that I could respect myself for shaking hands with a Nazi or an Imperial. This goes for all of you, by the way. Church, you're leading the Department of State, and I want you to make sure that every diplomat, ambassador, and embassy out there knows that we aren't going to be the kid that gets shoved around in the world anymore.

scp.4.desc:0 "Every Friday, the cafeteria of the mid-sized "Graphic Image" studio is just bustling with activity. Dozens of young creatives enjoy their brief period of recreational time and eagerly yearn for the long-awaited weekend. The food's good, too - today, a selection of sandwiches coupled with complimentary salads got served. At one table, Drew White sat with his colleague Edward Andrews and enjoyed his well deserved lunch break. Turning to Edward, he attempted to instigate some small talk:\n"I gotta say, this egg sandwich is pretty darn tasty. Anyways, how's progress on these new posters? I heard that you apparently had some really fantastic ideas for them." Edward could muster nothing but a tired shrug. For a moment, it seemed like he would say nothing at all - but then, the words just started to pour out of him like water from an overpressurized hose.\n\n"Oh, I'm almost done with them. It's just the same thing over and over, y'know. The Japanese octopus spreads it's tentacles all over the Pacific is a classic motiv, then you have a scary skull wearing one of these nazi hats - lately, I even combined these two to create a nazi skull with tentacles coming out of it's holes. It's pretty cliched at this point, but it gets the people going, I guess."\nHe paused for a few seconds, lowered his voice to a barely audible mutter, and continued. "This whole project is just so utterly depressive. When I went to college and got my degree in graphic design, I wanted to be a visionary. I wanted to design groundbreaking masterpieces that make people reassess how they view life itself. Now, I'm reduced to some kind of factory monkey pumping out the same three motifs to whip the masses into a warmongering frenzy. I'm nothing but a discount Goebbels, and I utterly despise myself for it."\n\nSilence. Drew, who has never been good at comforting people, attempted to defuse the situation: "Well, I - I understand your problems, buddy. Try eating one of these egg sandwiches, maybe that'll make you feel better.""

scp.5.t:0 "Friends Help Each Other Out"
scp.5.desc:0 "Audie Hoggard looked out into the field, with the sun rolling downwards as a beautiful red shade dawned upon the sky, with the day coming to a close above the lush, green fields of Quantico, Virginia. "They say the Program's gonna help out all active and reserve members of the military, and help out veterans as well. They even say it's gonna help their kids, I mean, shit, what a way to kick off the end of senior year, you know?" Audie had a few other friends there, Jodie Swaine, Cliff Haines, and Roy Norris. Everyone perked up at Audie's words, except for Roy.\n\n"Pfff, yeah, y'all get to enjoy y'alls lives in college, I get it. Guess who gets to work all of next year?" Roy said, lighting a cigarette while laughing.\n\n"Hey, lay off, Roy, things are just looking up for us is all." Cliff said.\n\n"Of course you'd say that, you little hopeful dipshit. Not everyones lives are as perfect as the shining pupil, bootlicking military brats you all are." Roy said, squinting at Cliff. Audie looked back, seeing Jodie's face meet the ground, as memories of her crying to him about her father being caught up in an artillery strike near Bloemfontein, and the horror he saw as he saw her dad resting in a hospital, talking to Jodie, missing an arm and having half of his face charred. Audie knew that Roy had it tough at home sometimes, and that all of them had suffered, but Audie realized he decided to make a choice.\n\nAt that moment, he didn't care.\n\nAudie's fist cracked against Roy's nose, sending a splatter of blood and dropping Roy to the ground. "What the fuck is wrong with you? God you're all fucking nuts." he said, clutching his nose while flicking the cigarette at Audie before he stormed off. The sting of regret pinched Audie's heart in that moment, but when he turned and saw Jodie cleaning off that tear going down her face, and Cliff giving him a slight smirk, Audie had an entirely different thought all together."

scp.6.t:0 "A Cause with No Home"
scp.6.desc:0 ""Godfuckingdamnit!" screamed Private Henry Prescott, as he kicked a massive dent into the front of his locker, causing his roommate to grab him and shove him back, making sure he didn't kick a hole in the wall or anything like that. He's lucky the mirror didn't crack, as it fell from the wall and bounced on the carpeted floor.\n\n"Henry, what the fuck was that, don't go busting shit up just cause you're mad!" cried his roommate, Private Wallace Deacon, as he ripped him back.\n\n"Don't tell me what the fuck to do, man!" screamed Prescott, as he went and laid down on his bed.\n\n"Look, I get it. I've been wanting to get a good education all my life, I've been wanting to be an engineer ever since I could hold a fucking wrench, I get it. The Army Modernization Program was gonna help us all out, get that education we all want, and the government fucked us. We can't go busting holes in things just cause we're mad about it though, Henry." Private Deacon said.\n\nBut Private Prescott couldn't relinquish his anger, nor the dents he's already caused in the room. He thought about back home in Virginia, where he wanted to work with kids, get them therapy, help them with their issues, he was always just a few hundred off from affording a college career, however. But dejection and disillusionment was all he could feel, as he looked up and saw President Jackson looking just as disappointed and pissed off as he was."
