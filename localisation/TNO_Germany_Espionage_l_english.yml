His strong enmity with Heinrich Himmler since the days of Fremde Heere Ost and ambition to unify the German swamp of intelligence agencies into one led him to this very point, as the President of the Reichsnachrichtendienst.\n\nYet, just as in the Second World War, Germany is in danger - and just as Fremde Heere Ost was not sufficient to Gehlen then, the Reichsnachrichtendienst is only a stepping stone for him. It would be wise to not underestimate the Fox and his ambition."

Friends and colleagues since the days of Fremde Heere Ost, Wessel soon distinguished himself as a man of iron stoicism, yet eloquent demeanor and sharp mind. Too sharp even for his former friend, in the end.\n\nFar from an ideologue, Wessel's leading principle is safety and stability for the Reich and the German people. This also means doing away with the Reichsnachrichtendienst's nature as a shady cabal it gained under Gehlen, instead transforming it into a service that is truly determined to protect not only the Führer or the Party but Germans as a whole.\n\nIn removing Gehlen from his control over the Reichsnachrichtendienst, the Reich gained - and the Führer, perhaps, lost. It remains to be seen if Wessel's loyalty to the people may bring him into conflict with the Führer."

Of course, this is to our advantage, as we desire a weaker neighbor in Russia. Shipments of arms, munitions, and money will soon commence, though we expect some will not find their destination.

The deal was closed already, but they stall the meeting like this?"\n\nOktan shot him an annoyed look. "Do not disrespect our benefactors, Vladimir. They chose us, and they trust in our movement." He poured some vodka into his glass. "I want to be alone now. You two," he pointed to the guards at the door, "get out." They all left in a hurry for fear of irritating their commander.\n\nThe Grand Marshall of the ROA felt tired. That was enough for a day's work, he thought. Oktan had just secured his position as the most powerful leader in Russia, with a few handshakes and pleasantries. A few words about his past in Moskowien had been enough. Of course, the ROA still need to crush some dissidents and communists, but now they had the best equipment to do so. The Reich had made the right choice backing him in the struggle against the Jews and communists in Russia. And all that money? Some of it was required to keep his smugglers in check.

The misinfo is already so widely spread one of our diplomats recently punched his counterpart right in the face, calling him a "puppet of Washington!"\n\nMore suspicious members of our government allege the leak of documents could be a foreign plant, pointing to several grammatical errors and an outdated orthography not seen in several decades, but that sort of spelling is sadly common in Russia after many years of lacking education. The more common belief is that the documents are a hoax by a disgruntled clerk or some ploy by warhawks in our government.

GER_Espionage.9.t:0 "Diplomacy In The Wasteland"
GER_Espionage.9.desc:0 "One of the great victories of the past decades was not only the destruction of the cancerous heart of bolshevism in the form of the Soviet Union, but also the annihilation of the unified state concept in Russia and its colonies. Never again would the Slav dare build a state to rival the might of the Reich, and in the absence of the strict authoritarianism of its successive governments, the illiterate Russian peasant would revert to his base instincts of violence and raiding for any meaningful future. Or at least, so we thought, joining the First Führer in his dismissal of the Russians. Then came the West Russian War, and while officially we swatted the bolshevik hordes aside with ease, in reality the state was severely weakened by the conflict and the integrity of our eastern lands was considerably compromised even up to this day.\n\nNow the spectre of that conflict rears its ugly head again. While we long expected there to be some sort of unification attempt between the unorganized warlords of European Russia and Western Siberia following the suspension of our punitive air raids during the Bürgerkrieg, an unexpected development was the reformation of the Siberian states thought collapsed in the fifties, thanks to a combination of foreign interference and refurbished Soviet industry.\n\nNow, Russia has been rapidly coalescing into two powerblocs faster than what any analyst thought possible, and what's worse, they appear to be engaging in diplomacy with each other. A reunified Russia cannot be allowed to happen; while we would of course win any potential conflict, the cost in lives, money, and damage to our Reichskommissariats could easily be prohibitive! We must direct our intelligence services to sabotage their diplomatic efforts!"

We have discovered that the movement's leader is General Pavel Batov, one of the leaders of the Sverdlovsk clique and subordinate of famous Soviet general Konstantin Rokossovsky. Batov has led this revolt since fleeing Sverdlovsk following the Black League's victory over Rokossovsky's forces. We have also noted that Yelena Karbysheva, daughter of the League's former leader, is also a member of this organization, and we could use her as a propaganda tool.\n\nBatov himself was displeased to work with us. While the General did not hide his distaste for the Reich, his hatred for the Black League was more important at the moment. Soon, we will send shipments of weapons through West Russia and Northern Kazakhstan, using well-established smuggler's routes in these regions.

Bullet holes filled the walls, pieces of paper and glass were littered all around. Of course, the bodies of five of Batov's insurgents also lay on the floor. The intel they received was accurate, at least. Five rebels were guarding a warehouse full of guns, though the weapons themselves were complicating everything.\n\nBatov's dogs started shooting as soon as the League's troops busted through the doors. It did not last more than five minutes. Soon, every enemy was dead, and Viktor and his troops needed to clean the mess the rebels left. Their mission was to capture the warehouse, but they also should have apprehended at least one of the bandits. Perhaps one could have revealed who had supplied them with German-made weapons. Most likely, the rebels had smuggled the guns from the West. Some were as old as the West Russian War, it seemed.\n\nNevertheless, Lieutenant Viktor was unsure of how to write his report. A warehouse filled with German guns and Batov's thugs was sure to attract the attention of the Black League's high command. Perhaps even the Glavkoverkh would read his words.

Nevertheless, there exists a few more regular divisions of Slavic troops alongside the native militias, and it is here we were able to find some purchase. An officer, upset at the lynching of his former superior, a man known as Rodzaevsky (see Appendix A: Reich Assets & Sympathizers In Harbin During The Weltkrieg), revealed that the overall commander of the regular divisions is a man named Pavel Sudoplatov, a former NKVD agent and independent power broker from The Father (see pg.9 for an abbreviated pre-war biography based on Moskowien records).\n\nTo bolster Sudoplatov's legitimacy as protector of the region vis a vis The Father, the Russia desk has suggested to use our contact's network of former Rodzaevsky followers to raid a series of villages near a garrison of regulars. We have hired a group of mercenaries formerly based out of the port of Magadan (see pg.11) to ensure the regulars win the skirmish, and if possible, ensure our contact does not survive it. See following pages for details of the operation.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS."

RND.2.d:0 "Speer paused for a moment, tears welling in his eyes. The small crowd hung onto his every motion as if they were glued to him. Finally, after a moment to collect himself, Speer began.\n\n"I'm heartbroken, absolutely heartbroken, to be here today, mourning the passing of one of my oldest friends. Karl Brandt was a good man. He was a man dedicated to science and medicine, and he was one of my closest friends back in the day. Though we may have drifted apart as time went on, the bond that was shared between us never died, and I could not possibly express my full grief at his untimely passing. That an automobile accident struck down such a gem of our Reich serves as a terrible reminder that all of us are merely human, and must treasure and cherish our days on Earth..."\n\nHowever, if Karl Brandt, currently resting peacefully in his coffin, could speak instead of Speer, his story would have been vastly different than the eulogy that the Führer gave. Perhaps he would have regaled the audience with how, while he was returning from work, a truck veered out in front of him, forcing him off the road at high speeds. He may have emphasized how, while he was dazed and stunned by the crash, multiple RND men surrounded his vehicle. He certainly would have screamed about how the man in front of the wreck, noticing how Brandt still moved, drew his pistol and put one bullet directly through Brandt's skull. Brandt would have closed his tale on the fire, set by those same men that killed him, that engulfed the car and destroyed the evidence that they had ever been involved.\n\nBut Karl Brandt was dead, and so the crowd gave a standing ovation to their Führer as he concluded, not even suspecting the truth behind the untimely death of Karl Brandt."

RND.3.d:0 "KATTOWITZ - Tragic news for the Reich's bureaucrats today as Karl Hanke, a personal friend of the Führer and decorated former Gauleiter of Silesia, has been murdered! The stalwart veteran of the NSDAP had been holidaying at a hunting lodge near Kattowitz with Silesian troops on leave, but failed to return from his evening walk last night. When the soldiers went out to search for him the following morning, they found Hanke lying unresponsive against a tree, with multiple gunshot wounds to his chest. One of the Landsers, a medic, pronounced Hanke dead at the scene. A subsequent coroner's report found that Hanke had been dead for several hours before being discovered. More concerningly, it has been confirmed that Hanke was shot with a Polish submachine gun or pistol, casings from which were found nearby. Local Ordnungspolizei officers confirmed that a Polish terrorist cell had been active across the border with the General Government in recent years, and at least one member remained at large.\n\n"This is a terrible shock to me," said the Führer of Hanke's murder. "As many Party faithful know, it was Hanke's recommendation to the late Dr. Goebbels that began my career in the government. Not only do I owe him my position as Führer, but he was also a dear friend and confidant of many years. I hope with all my heart that our brave police officers and detectives can bring this case to a satisfying conclusion and enact justice for my friend and colleague."\n\nKarl Hanke had been a mildly controversial figure in recent years, owing to his long-standing support for the SS. He faced criticism at times from fellow NSDAP members for his political views, but was fully exonerated of alleged ties to treasonous elements by the Führer himself shortly after the Bürgerkrieg. Hanke is survived by his wife, Baroness Freda von Fircks, and their daughter."

In a sweaty and unbuttoned shirt, with arms folded over his chest, Sato swallowed his breath and began to gasp:\n\n"We traced our leads back... through interrogation, front organisation, and the lot..." he paused, taking in a deep breath, "it goes back to Germania; the money, the maps, the intelligence. This is an assault on our sovereignty. They're treading on our toes and trying to fuck with us, more than ever before...""

HVA.6.desc:0 "To the German Führer,\n\nIt has come to the Emperor's attention that you have engaged in funding several well-known terrorist groups, individuals responsible for the mass slaughter of innocents and the destruction of property. These groups have committed many of their atrocities using money and equipment provided to them by the German Reich for the express purpose of sabotaging those native governments and their efforts to maintain peace and prosperity in their homelands.\n\nYour pathetic and cowardly attempts to sabotage Pan-Asian Brotherhood are entirely unwelcome, and border on an invitation of war. It was not difficult to deduce your involvement, as your country's brazen-ness is only matched only by your country's incompetence, as the Sphere remains as strongly united as ever.\n\nIn the interests of the continued survival of the German Reich, it is advised that such covert operations within our territory cease immediately. Further action in an attempt to destabilize the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere will be met with just and equal retribution by the Empire of Japan. You have been warned once, and will not be warned again."

HVA.7.desc:0 "Dariush had long admired the idea of democracy. His brother, Zana, had studied in America, and he had come back espousing ideals of freedom and the right to representative government. Dariush had been beside him all the while. While he had never seen such a system in action, he had nevertheless joined in on his brother's pro-democracy protests, calling for free elections to guide the people of Iran instead of some German-backed Shah.\n\nThe police had interrupted this protest, rather violently. The two brothers, alongside many of their friends, had been taken captive. The next morning, they were bound, blindfolded, and told to march until the police told them to stop. Were they being taken to some far-away prison, or paraded around as examples? Or was it just an attempt to scare them straight?\n\nThe two brothers did as they were told, occasionally exchanging a worried whisper in the direction they thought the other one was. It felt like they were marching for hours, though it was difficult to tell. Eventually, the order came for the march to end. They were to stand in place and wait until they received further instructions.\n\nThey stood for a few moments, until Dariush heard a rather distinct voice. It was saying something in German. Unable to contain his curiosity, the young activist pushed his blindfold ever so slightly up, until he could see through it. He let out a sharp gasp. "What is it?" His brother pressed. Dariush's words came out shakily."

No matter how much aid we give the Ba'athists, the governments have military infrastructure that rebels and insurgents simply do not. It is a simple fact of life that we cannot give these to our allies. However, we are able to take them from their enemies, and this serves to level the playing field just as much.\n\nBy supplying bombers and munitions to the Ba'athists, we will give them everything they need to destroy this infrastructure themselves. However, we cannot trust that they will be entirely able to do it on their own. After all, they have nowhere near the power or the resources at the disposal of the Great German Reich.\n\nWe will begin selling faulty equipment to the countries of our enemies. Furthemore, we will send local operatives to destroy, sabotage, or otherwise prevent proper use of equipment, both military and industrial. With the Ba'athists supplied with German arms, and the Arabs deprived of means to make their own, it will be a sure victory.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS."

HVA.9.desc:0 "Darkness. Albert Speer inhaled. Fabric penetrated his mouth. Tires screeched. His heart thumped. Albert Speer exhaled. The bag over his head captured the warm breath.\n\nThe car jolted to a sudden stop. He heard something wrench open. Crushing cold air swept inside, devouring his body to the bone. He raised two trembling hands in weak surrender. Something grabbed him roughly and pulled him from the car. He staggered to his feet, hands above his head, his breathing quickening. Something hard pressed into his back. Click. He started walking.\n\n"Speer jetzt," a voice behind him whispered mockingly. It was German. He had not heard a German voice in so long. He heard laughter laced with malice from elsewhere.\n\nHow long was he forced to walk for? An hour? Five hours? Or was it just five minutes? His whole body was numb from the cold. The leaves crunched beneath his feet. Finally, they ordered him to stop and kneel.\n\nWere these men Nazi-hunters? Fellow German exiles? Bolsheviks, or democrats? Were they Bormann's secret agents? Or the President's? OrPo, or CIA? His mind was racing and stuttering like an overheating car engine. He thought of his wife and children. He thought of the German race, doomed to collapse. He thought of Germania in all its glory. He thought of Adolf Hitler and his bold vision for the future.\n\nHe thought of his father, that distant man with cold eyes.\n\nThe gunshot rang out. His body slumped into the ditch, silent and still."

Albert Speer was free to walk the streets of America. There was no security, no cameras, no constant risk of kidnap or murder by a foreign agent or a lunatic. He could just... walk.\n\nHe was no fool. A large hat sat on his balding scalp, and he surveyed his surroundings in all its capitalistic greed through his sunglasses. He didn't want to risk recognition, but sought comfort in the knowledge that the odds of such a thing had decreased.\n\nAs he daydreamed of his soaring book sales, an unassuming figure stepped into view. He was a rather small fellow in a grey suit and bulky glasses. The man tried to step around Speer but bumped into him by accident.\n\n"My apologies," Speer laughed.\n\n"Heil Bormann," the man replied, wrenching a gun from his pocket and shooting Speer six times in the chest.\n\nSpeer dropped to the ground with a pained gasp. His body felt cold, but the blood was warm. He thought of his wife and children. He thought of Adolf Hitler and his bold vision for the future.\n\nHe thought of his father, that distant man with cold eyes."

HVA.11.desc:0 "Kiesinger stared silently at the men huddling around him. Reformist dissidents all, in hiding since Speer's collapse during the Bürgerkrieg. Since the assassination attempt a week prior, they had all fled to another safehouse on the other side of Switzerland. Erhard and a few others had already fled the country, presumably towards one of the German communities in South America they had discussed escaping to during exile.\n\nThe nightmares about that day never ceased. One moment Kiesinger had been milling around in the snow, contemplating his next move. The next, three gunshots had torn through the air. One had driven itself deep into the steaming snow. Another had blown through the head of Kiesinger's bodyguard. The third had struck Kiesinger himself in the spine, pushing him to the ground like a puppet without strings.\n\nIt had been a painful and arduous process, but Kiesinger had survived and fled with the help of his fellow exiled dissidents. Those same dissidents who were nervously holding a letter, assuring him it contained no traces of poison. It was signed by Martin Bormann himself. The OrPo knew where Kiesinger had fled to. Yet he was still alive. Why?\n\n"'To Herr Kurt Georg Kiesinger'," Edgar Metze began, voice trembling. "'You are a traitor to the Reich and the Aryan race. We discovered your new Swiss den with ease, and could have killed you at any point in the last week. However, my spies have informed me that you are paralysed from the neck down as a result of our first assassination attempt. I have therefore pardoned you of your crimes and called off my agents. You shall spend the rest of your life in exile as a subhuman cripple, wallowing in your own filth as your Fatherland thrives without you. Heil Bormann!'""
