RNDflavour.1.t:0 "RND - 예비 보고 3"
RNDflavour.1.d:0 ""여기에 이름, 직업, 현 임무를 말해주십시오." 삑 소리 두 번. "여기 마이크에 말해주십시오. 당신이 현재 감시당하고 있으며 이 인터뷰가 진행되는 동안 모든 발언이 기록된다는 점을 고지드립니다. 말씀을 시작해주십시오. 셋. 둘. 하나."\n\n거칠고 치직거리는 목소리가 허공에 울려퍼짐. "이름은 에리히 피셔, 간첩 요원으로서 국가정보국에서 일하고 있습니다. 제 현 임무는 노예 사회에 침투하고 RND에 완전한 수준의 보고서를 제출하는 것이며, 저는 여기에 그 일을 마치기 위해 왔습니다."\n\n"저-" 스피커에서 위잉하는 소리가 들렸고, 발걸음 소리가 녹음실을 울림. "신경쓰지 마십시오, 에리히 요원. 임무는 어떻게 진행되었습니까? 어떤 심각한 문제를 마주쳤나요, 아니면 어떤 식으로든 무언가를 발견했나요?"\n\n"일은 아주 잘 돌아갔습니다. 문제는 전혀 없었습니다. 노예들은 전혀 의심하지 않았고, 그렇지 않았다면 제가 여기 살아서 앉아있지 못했을 겁니다." 피식거리는 웃음. "미안합니다. 자존심 문제라서요."\n\n"괜찮습니다. 마저 보고해주십시오."\n\n"네, 알겠습니다." 서류 바스락거리는 소리. "국가정보국은 저를 오버슐레지엔에 있는 카토비츠 근처 노예수용소에 배치시켰습니다. 그 이전에 RND는 수용소 경비대와 중앙 조직에게 저를 노예들과 동등하게 대우하라 지시했습니다." 한숨. "저는 다른 곳에 배치되기를 바랬습니다만, 하루도 지나지 않아 지독하게도 그곳에 배치되더군요. 저는 노예들의 언어를 배웠습니다. 폴란드어, 우크라이나어, 약간의 러시아어말입니다. 그리고 저는 그걸 알 수 있었습니다..." 거친 목소리가 차츰 잦아듦.\n\n잠시 뒤. "무엇을 알 수 있었습니까?"\n\n"나쁜 소식의 조짐을 알려드리게 되어 유감입니다." 반복되는 깊은 한숨. "국기단, 더 나아가 스파르타쿠스단은 홀로 움직이지 않습니다. 노예들 사이에서 나타나는 정치적 운동에 관한 소문들이 존재합니다. 저는 지금 아주..." 잠깐의 정적. "피상적인 소식만을 전해드려 걱정스럽습니다. 그들이 누군지에 대한 힌트만을 가지고 있습니다."\n\n조금 긴 정적. 속삭임. "국가에 대한 봉사에 감사드립니다, 피셔 씨. 이제 저희는 당신께 몇 가지 질문들을 더 드리려 합니다. 계속 진행할까요?""
RNDflavour.1.a:0 "그럽시다."

speerpoland.1.t:0 "OKW의 제안"
speerpoland.1.d:0 "헤닝 폰 트레슈코프는 항상 옷을 아주 잘 차려입는 사람이었고, 오늘 역시 예외는 없었다. 유별날 정도로 잘 다려지고 깨끗한 그의 군복은 슈파이델의 군복마저 더럽고 구겨진 것처럼 보이게 했다. 하지만 슈파이델의 군복 역시 그 무엇보다 훌륭해보였다. 둘은 함께 총통에게 보고서를 제출하였다. 트레슈코프의 군복이 깔끔해보이고, 슈파이델의 군복이 괜찮아 보였다면, 슈페어의 양복은 주름과 잉크 자국으로 난장판이 되어 있었다.\n\n"슈파이델, 트레슈코프. 자네들의 계획에 대해 설명을 들을 수 있을까?" 슈페어는 보고서의 글자에서 눈을 돌리며 부드럽게 말했다. 트레슈코프는 목을 가다듬고 이내 말을 시작했다.\n\n"독일은 새로운 폴란드 정부에 대하여 수많은 우위를 확보하고 있습니다. 하지만 그 중에서도 가장 분명한 것은 군사적인 우위일 것입니다, 슈페어 씨. 군은 폴란드 인들이 보여주는 그 어떤 것도 왜소하게 만들 것입니다. 이 사실을 장점으로 사용할 것을 권해 드리는 바입니다." 슈파이델은 그에 맞춰 고개를 끄덕였다. 슈페어는 서류를 내려놓았다.\n\n"그래서 침공하자고?" 그는 직설적으로 물었다. 트레슈코프는 이마를 찡그렸지만 말을 이어갔다.\n\n"아닙니다, 아닙니다. 가급적이면 안 하는 편이 낫습니다. 폴란드인들을 강제로 무릎 꿇히게 하는데 침공 협박만큼 충분한 것도 없을 것입니다. 그에 추가하여, 폴란드에게 이익을 줄 다수의 행동 역시 우리가 제국에 미친 광신도가 더 이상 아니며 자애로운 관리자라는 인식을 그들에게 심는데 도움을 줄지 모릅니다."\n\n슈페어는 미소를 지었다. "마음에 드는군. 얼마든지 추진하게."\n\n"그리고 총통 각하. 만일 그 자들이 거절한다면 말입니다. 음, 침공 협박이 의미가 없게 되지는 않을 것입니다." 슈파이델이 입가에 희미한 미소를 지으며 말을 보탰다. 슈페어는 고개를 끄덕이며 흥미롭다는 듯이 지켜보았다."
speerpoland.1.a:0 "어떻게 되는지 두고 보자고."

speerpoland.2.t:0 "독일의 위협"
speerpoland.2.d:0 "나쁜 소식이 오늘 바르샤바에 전해졌습니다. 독일인들이 돌아오고 있습니다. 슈파이델 원수가 대강 그려낸 이 계획은 폴란드 땅에 돌아오려는 독일인들의 계획을 열거하고 있습니다. 만일 이 계획이 수용되지 않는다면, 폴란드가 침공을 견뎌내지 못할 것은 분명한 사실입니다. 독일은 어떤 방식으로든 패권을 차지할 것입니다."
speerpoland.2.a:0 "받아들여라"
speerpoland.2.b:0 "거부해라"

speerpoland.3.t:0 "올바른 남자"
speerpoland.3.d:0 "오늘 두 장의 편지가 슈페어의 책상을 장식하고 있었다. 그 중 하나는 다른 것보다 훨씬 더 그를 행복하게 만들어주었다.\n\n첫번째 것은 OKW에서 온 것이었다. 누가 폴란드 점령을 위해 선택될지에 대한 문제는 다루기 힘든 것이었으며, 슈페어의 책상에 놓인 두 장의 편지는 양 쪽의 의견을 괜찮게 대변하고 있었다. 한 손에는 트레슈코프로부터 온 편지가 있었다. 그는 육군에 있는 오래된 친구 베르너 슈라더를 추천했다. 트레슈코프의 추천서 중에서도 주된 부분은 슈라더가 국방군에 있을 적의 이야기였다. 군부가 항상 고집했던 대단한 규모의 잔혹 행위들에 대한 저항의 이야기였다. 트레슈코프의 주장은 이 저항 행위를 근거로 삼고 있었다. 무엇보다, 평범한 국방군의 남자가 라이히의 새로운 얼굴을 위태롭게 하지 않고 폴란드에서 통제권을 쥘 수 있겠는가?\n\n두 번째 편지는 훨씬 더 짜증나는 것이었다. 페르디난트 쇠르너가 직접 보낸 편지였다. 그는 슈페어가 생각하기에 모든 악의 근원이었다. 이 편지는 40년대에서 직접 보내진 것처럼 보였다. 라이히의 새로운 방향, 폴란드에 대한 라이히의 결정, 폴란드 민족에 대한 모든 것에 반대하는 긴 장광설이 이어진 뒤, 쇠르너의 편지에는 저 옛날 라이히의 대량학살 정책으로 즉시 돌아가야 한다는 요구가 적혀 있었다. 말도 안되는군. 슈페어는 생각했다. 쇠르너에게 모든 것은 못이었고, 자신은 항상 망치였다. 그는 아직도 전쟁이 끝났음을 모르는 것처럼 행동했다.\n\n선택은 너무나 명확했다. 슈페어는 슈라더의 포트폴리오를 승인하며 트레슈코프에게 답장을 보냈다. 뒤늦게 슈페어는 쇠르너의 편지를 쓰레기통에 던져버렸다."
speerpoland.3.a:0 "세상은 계속해서 움직인다."

speerpoland.4.t:0 "가는 것이 있으면 오는 것도 있는 법"
speerpoland.4.d:0 "제10전차사단이 폴란드에 처음으로 진입한 것은 1939년이었다. 그 뒤 그들은 유럽의 들판에서 싸우며 헤쳐 나갔고, 폴란드 육군을 격파했으며, 바르샤바 전투라는 지옥으로 행군해나갔다. 수천 명이 죽어나간 끝애야, 바르샤바와 폴란드는 그들의 것이 되었다.\n\n사단장은 다시는 그런 일이 일어나지 않기를 희망했다.\n\n군인들은 출입구를 열면서 폴란드 쪽에 있는 국경 수비대를 지켜보았다. 도로 저편에 매복이 있나? 시야에 독일인이 들어오면 모두 사살할 준비가 되어 있는 사단 하나가 있지는 않을까? 그들이 진군하자, 전차장들은 해치를 닫고 총을 준비하여 곧 다가올 공격에 준비하고 있었다.\n\n그럼에도 불구하고 그들은 수 킬로미터를 전진해왔으나 그 어떤 공격도 받지 않았다. 그들의 공포는 믿기지 않는다는 감정으로 바뀌기 시작했다. 그들이 첫 번째 마을에 다다르자, 모든 전차장들은 침묵 속에서 땀을 흘리고 있었다. 국내군(Armia Krajowa) 사단은 그들을 지켜보며 막 무장해제를 하고 있던 것이다. 시작이구나. 대부분은 그렇게 생각했다. 모두가 지옥으로 돌입하는 바로 그 순간이었다.\n\n 폴란드군은 사실상 자신의 소총을 반납하기 시작했고, 이때 믿을 수 없다는 표정이 제10전차사단 병사들의 얼굴에 드러났다. 그리고 폴란드군은 자신의 의약품과 식량 역시 반납했다. 폴란드군 사령관은 줄의 맨 마지막에 있었다. 그도 자신의 음식과 약품을 가져왔고, 독일군 사령관의 어리둥절한 눈을 뚫어져라 쳐다보았다. 그리고 떠나기 전 히죽히죽 웃음을 보였다."
speerpoland.4.a:0 "새로운 시대가 열렸다."

speerpoland.5.t:0 "이른 귀환"
speerpoland.5.d:0 "바르샤바 기차역 주변에는 군중들이 역 밖을 넘어 도로로 몇 블럭을 따라 줄지어 있었다. 수천 명의 사람들이 철도를 따라 서 있었고, 가능한 한 아주 귀중한 화물을 꽉꽉 실은 독일 기차를 지켜보고 있었다. 저 멀리 첫 연기가 눈에 보이자 흥분된 기색이 군중들 사이를 휩쓸었고, 경찰들은 혹시 모를 일에 대비했다.\n\n기차가 역에 막 들어오자, 고요한 긴장감이 군중 사이에 감돌았다. 독일 수비대가 주위를 지키고 군중들 사이를 뚫기 위해 화물차에서 뛰어내리자 사람들은 목을 길게 빼고 지켜보았다. 긴장된 분위기는 더욱 심해졌으며 화물칸 문이 열리자 분위기에 압사할 것만 같았다.\n\n여전히 죄수복을 입고 있던 노예가 천천히 밖으로 걸어나오자, 믿지 못하겠다는 정적이 흘렀다. 갑자기 군중들은 환호성을 질렀다. 발을 구르고, 소리를 질렀다. 경찰들은 수천 명의 무게를 견디며 압박을 받아야 했다. 노예들이 밖으로 나와 길로 걸어나오자, 꽃이 그들의 머리 위로 쏟아졌다. 가족들은 사랑하는 사람들을 보기 위해 안간힘을 쓰고 있었다.\n\n어쩌면 오늘은 혁명 이후 모든 폴란드인들에게 진정 기쁨을 느낄 수 있는 첫 번째 날일지도 몰랐다. 오늘은 사랑하는 가족들이 고향에 돌아온 날이었다. 만일 독일인들이 그들과 함께 온다면, 그렇게 둘 것이다."
speerpoland.5.a:0 "채찍보다는 당근이지."

speerpoland.6.t:0 "폴란드가 수용하다"
speerpoland.6.d:0 "오늘 바르샤바로부터 좋은 소식이 전해졌습니다. 폴란드 정부가 다른 어떤 대안도 택하지 못하는 자신의 절망적인 상황을 인정하여 항복하기로 결정한 것으로 보입니다. 슈파이델의 제안이 완전히 받아들여졌으며, 평화를 위한 조건들이 이미 집행되기 시작하고 있습니다.\n\n슈페어 각하께서는 그 소식을 읽으시고 미소를 지으셨고, 항상 그분을 괴롭히던 편두통이 없어졌음을 느끼셨습니다. 슈파이델을 보내주시어 신께 정말 감사드립니다. 어떤 조약 조항들도, 어떤 협상도, 어떤 논쟁도 없었습니다. 단순히 간단하고 명명백백한 말과 간단하고 명명백백한 답변만이 있었습니다. 그 어떤 독일인도 폴란드에서 죽지 않을 것이며, 슈페어 각하의 또 다른 승리가 전해져 올 것입니다.\n\n각하께서는 자리에 앉으시고 슈파이델을 초대하여 술이나 한두 잔 해야겠다는 결심을 마음 속으로 하셨습니다. 그 사람은 그럴만할 자격이 있습니다."
speerpoland.6.a:0 "훌륭해."

speerpoland.7.t:0 "폴란드가 거부하다"
speerpoland.7.d:0 "오늘 바르샤바에서 너무나 충격적인 소식이 전해졌습니다. 폴란드 정부가 정신이 나간 것 같습니다. 적어도 총통 각하 사무실에서 들려오는 말에 따르면, 우리가 예상했던 외교적 승리 대신에 우리의 제안이 놀랍게도 거절당했다고 합니다. 이를 단순히 예상치 못한 일이라고 부르는 것은 엄청난 과소평가가 될 것입니다. 또한 이를 단순히 어리석은 일이라고 부르는 것 역시 엄청난 과소평가가 될 것입니다. 폴란드는 라이히의 전쟁 기계에 맞설 승산이 전혀 없습니다. 이 결정은 민족의 자부심을 유지하려는 필사적인 움직임의 일환으로 내려진 것처럼 보입니다. 그 동기가 무엇이든 간에, 폭력이 피할 수 없게 되었음은 분명합니다.\n\n슈페어 각하께서는 거절을 표하는 글을 읽고 머리가 두통으로 울리는 것을 느낄 수 있었습니다. 각하께서는 격분하셔서 편지를 쓰레기통에 던져버리셨습니다. 그들이 정말 진지하게 임한 것일까요? 그들이 독일군에 맞서 승산이 있다고 생각하는 걸까요? 이 모든 것이 슈페어 각하의 인생을 최대한 힘들게 만들려는 시도에 불과하지는 않을까요? 그 중 어느 편이 되었던간에, 한 가지는 분명합니다. 독일의 군화가 다시금 침략군으로서 폴란드의 들판을 행군할 것이라는 점입니다. 총통 각하께서는 자리에 앉으며 한숨을 쉬셨습니다. 이는 라이히스탁을 난장판으로 만들 것입니다. 각하께서는 슈파이델이 나쁜 협상가인만큼 나쁜 지휘관이 아니기를 바랄 수 있을 뿐입니다."
speerpoland.7.a:0 "망할."

speerpoland.8.t:0 "부드럽게 말하다"
speerpoland.8.d:0 ""그래서, 슈미트. 자네 계획을 한 번 읽어보았네." 슈페어는 책상에 앉아 슈미트 외무장관을 올려다보았다. "자네가 더 자세히 나에게 설명해주었으면 하네. 솔직히 말해서 나는 왜 우리가 폴란드 같은 땅에 이렇게 많은 노력을 들이부어야 하는지 이해할 수가 없거든."\n\n슈미트는 넥타이를 꽉 조였다. "이는 폴란드 그 자체보다는 국제적인 영향을 더 고려한 것입니다, 총통 각하."\n\n 슈페어는 의자에 기대어 앉았다. "자세히 말해보게."\n\n"네, 우리는 30년대처럼 폴란드인들에게 무력을 통해 우리의 의지를 관철시킬 수 있지만, 주된 문제는 국제적으로 그러한 행위가 신사적인 라이히라는 개혁가적인 이미지를 위협할 것이라는 점입니다."\n\n"자네 계획의 문제는 우리가 지키고 싶지 않은 약속들을 하게 만들 것 같다는 점이야. 슈미트."\n\n"저도 제 계획이 완벽하지 않음을 압니다. 하지만 우리의 이미지를 유지하기 위해서는 이 방법밖에 없습니다. 또한 협상이란 피가 튀기지 않는 법 아닙니까. 우리 모두가 유혈사태를 원하지 않습니다. 그렇지 않습니까?" 슈미트는 미소를 지었다.\n\n"물론이지. 당연히 원하지 않아. 자네가 이 일을 추진할 수 있도록 허가하겠네. 나를 위해서라도 이 일을 말아먹지는 말게. 알았지?" 슈페어는 의자를 이리저리 끌었다. 슈미트는 고개를 끄덕이고 방을 나갔다. 라이히가 새로운 위치를 얻을 희망이 그의 어깨 위에 무겁게 자리하고 있었다."
speerpoland.8.a:0 "어떻게 될지 두고보자고."

speerpoland.9.t:0 "독일의 협상 제안"
speerpoland.9.d:0 "오늘 게르마니아에서 놀라운 소식이 전해졌습니다. 라이히의 외무장관 헬무트 슈미트가 라이히와 폴란드 사이의 평화를 협상하기를 바라는 것으로 보입니다. 여기에 동의해야 할까요? 만일 여기서 거절한다면 라이히가 침공해 올 것입니다. 우리가 대단히 희망할지 몰라도, 그들을 꺾기란 거의 불가능에 가깝습니다."
speerpoland.9.a:0 "동의하라"
speerpoland.9.b:0 "거부하라"

speerpoland.10.t:0 "미래로 한 발짝"
speerpoland.10.d:0 "그 소식은 외무부의 손을 빠르게 빠져나가 헬무트 슈미트와 알베르트 슈페어의 사무실로 곧바로 향했다. 그 소식은 마치 축하할 만한 일처럼 보였다. 오랜 숙고와 논쟁 끝에, 폴란드인들은 헬무트 슈미트와의 대화를 수용했다. 이에 더하여 그들이 적기를, 폴란드와 독일이 앞으로 떠오를 미래에 유럽을 가져오는데 함께 힘쓰기를 바라며 이 대화가 그 기반을 마련하는데 배경 작업이 되어야 한다. 물론 이는 모두 외교적 아첨이다. 일찍이 그 누구도 감히 인정사정없이 정직하지 못했으니 말이다. 하지만 이 정도면 독일에게 충분하다. 특히 슈미트와 슈페어 각하께도 충분할 것이다.\n\n슈페어의 사무실에서, 알베르트는 한 잔 들이키며 한숨을 내쉬고 편지를 읽었다. 그의 마음 속에서는 걱정이 춤추고 있었다. 만일 그들이 라이히의 손길이 뻗치도록 행동하면 어떨까? 슈미트가 별과 태양을 따다주겠다고 약속했다면 어쩌지? 하지만 지금 당장은 그 질문들을 제쳐두었다. 상황은 매끄럽게 돌아가고 있었다. 비록 그가 개인적으로 슈미트를 싫어한다 할지라도, 슈미트가 잘 해주고 있는 것은 인정해야 했다.\n\n슈미트의 사무실에서, 헬무트는 그 소식을 기쁘게 받아들였다. 그들이 제안을 받아들일 거라 기대했지만, 사실 이 일은 그에게 시작에 불과했다. 폴란드인들의 협조로, 그는 최종적으로 상황을 올바르게 정돈할 수 있을 것이다. 유럽은 빛나는 미래에 한 발짝 더 다가설 것이다."
speerpoland.10.a:0 "폴란드의 희망은 여전히 불안정하다."

speerpoland.11.t:0 "후퇴"
speerpoland.11.d:0 "그 소식은 거쳐가는 모든 사람들의 사기를 꺾어놓았다. 개혁파들에게는 번개가 떨어진 것 같았고, 슈페어파에게는 공포스러운 차질이었다. 그 소식은 외무부를 통해 미끄러져 내려가 슈페어와 슈미트의 책상에 쿵 하고 떨어졌다. 거기에 적힌 그 소식은 만일 진짜가 아니었다면 코미디로 여겨졌을 것이다. 폴란드인들은 무슨 정신나간 이유에서인지 협상을 거부하고 최후의 한 사람까지 폴란드를 사수할 것이라 선언했다. 협상은 미처 시작될 기회를 얻기도 전에 죽었다.\n\n슈페어의 사무실에서, 알베르트는 한숨을 쉬는 동시에 분노하며 끙 앓는 소리를 내고 있었다. 그는 슈미트의 말을 딱 한 번 들어보았다. 이제 그 결과가 어떠한지 보라. 폴란드인들은 자신이 약하다고 생각했고, 독일이 그들을 상대하려 하지 않을 것이라 생각했으며, 이 모든 일은 슈미트가 광견병에 걸린 개에게 당근을 던져주기로 결정했기 때문이었다. 이제 육군의 손을 더럽혀야 했다. 그는 이미 하켄크로이츠 깃발에 싸인 관들이 진흙투성이인 지옥문에서 고향으로 돌아오는 것을 볼 수 있었다. 그는 1마일 떨어진 라이히스탁에서 벌어지는 개같은 일들을 볼 수 있었다. 슈미트의 뜻대로 하게 두었다. 이제 그 결과가 어떠한지 보라.\n\n슈미트의 사무실은 슈페어의 사무실보다 훨씬 더 침체되어 있었다. 헬무트는 대단히 분노하며 편지를 쓰레기통에 내동댕이쳤다. 그는 도박을 벌였으나, 알 수 없는 이유로 폴란드인들은 판을 엎어버렸다. 무슨 일이 일어날지 생각은 한 걸까? 그들이 벌인 일들은 모든 이의 상황을 악화시키고 있었다. 슈미트는 자리에 앉아서 백만 명의 관리들에게서 걸려오는 분노의 전화를 기다렸다. 계획은 완전히 무너졌고 그는 자체로 거대한 표적이 되어 있었다. 그는 술 한 잔을 들어 쭉 들이켰다."
speerpoland.11.a:0 "자신들이 뭘 하고 있는지 알기나 할까?"

speerpoland.12.t:0 "폴란드의 독일인들"
speerpoland.12.d:0 "회의실에 앉아 있는 양 대표단 사이에는 긴장감이 두껍고 무겁게 감돌았다. 슈미트의 눈은 긴장한듯이 폴란드 측 협상가들의 얼굴을 바라보고 있었으며, 마지막에는 그들의 머리를 살피고 있었다. 그 중에서도 스타니슬라프 바호비아크가 눈에 띄었다. 바호비아크의 눈은 슈미트를 뚫어지게 쏘아보고 있었으며, 시계가 12시를 알리자 회의가 공식적으로 시작되었다.\n\n온갖 외교적인 용어로 가득한 처음의 사교적인 인사는 이내 사라졌고, 베일에 싸인 가시 돋친 말들과 제안들이 이내 책상 양 쪽에 오갔다. 그다지 놀랍지 않게도, 얼마 지나지 않아서 첫 번째 장애물이 나타났다. 폴란드 내 독일인들의 지위에 관한 문제였다.\n\n"폴란드 내 독일인들이 총독부 아래에서 받고 있는 특별한 지위는 받아들일 수 없습니다! 우리는 그들과 비교했을 때 사실상 사물이나 다름 없었습니다! 자신의 국가를 가진 이등신민이라뇨! 우리는 옛날의 관습을 반복할 수도, 그것으로 되돌아갈 수도 없습니다. 지금 당장부터 영원히 말입니다! 그들은 한때 지녔던 특권들을 계속해서 유지할 수 없을 것입니다!" 바호비아크는 책상을 진심으로 내리치면서 분노로 가득 찬 고함을 끝냈고, 폴란드 측 대표단으로부터 박수갈채를 받았다. 독일 대표단은 슈미트를 돌아보았다. 그의 얼굴은 생각에 깊게 잠겨 있었다. 뉘른베르크 법의 부분적인 폐지라. 수 년간 그가 바랐던 것이지만, 슈페어의 기대와는 정면으로 충돌하는 것이리라. 게다가 아직도 독일인의 대부분이 "운터멘쉬"라 생각하고 있는 폴란드인들이 원하는대로 독일인들의 권리를 지우는 것은, 의심할 여지 없이 언젠가는 어차피 일어날 일을 기다리는 더러운 상황을 조성할 것이었다. 하지만 이러한 경고가 없어도 폴란드인들이 합의를 수용할까? 그는 이 말들이 자신을 영원히 쫓아다닐 것을 기억하며 한숨을 쉬었고, 이내 대답을 하기 위해 입을 열었다."
speerpoland.12.a:0 "법을 지속시켜야 합니다."
speerpoland.12.b:0 "폴란드인들은 권리를 얻을 자격이 있습니다."

speerpoland.13.t:0 "국내군의 지위"
speerpoland.13.d:0 ""바호비아크 씨, 이제 다음 주제로 넘어갑시다. 국내군 문제입니다." 슈미트는 말을 시작하기 전에 잠시 심호흡을 했다. 그리고 천천히 자신의 안건 목록을 읽어나갔다. "앞에서 동의한 바 있듯이, 국내군은 무장이 해제되어 해체될 것입니다. 이 회담이 통과된다고 가정하면 말입니다. 맞습니까?"\n\n"물론입니다." 바호비아크는 말을 이어나가며 넥타이를 조였다. 슈미트는 다음 주제로 넘어오자 눈알을 굴렸고, 이내 충격적인 발언을 하기 위해 마음을 다잡았다.\n\n"네, 물론입니다. 허나 독일의 좀 더 보수적인 세력에서는 그 자들 중 몇몇을 기소하라 요구하고 있습니다만..." 슈미트는 바호비아크가 이미 얼굴이 시뻘개지는 것을 볼 수 있었다. 그는 폭발을 준비하고 있었다. "아, 반역죄와 테러의 죄목으로 말입니다. 바호비아크 씨, 이 자들은 이제 독일 주둔군에 대하여 폭력을 행사한 죄로 기소될 것입니다-"\n\n바호비아크는 벌떡 일어섰다. "농담도 심하시군요, 슈미트 씨! 장난치지 마십시오! 감히 자유를 위한 투쟁을 테러라 칭하신 겁니까? 국내군을 무장해제하는 것에 동의를 받는 것도 얼마나 어려웠는지 알기나 하십니까? 그들은 분노로 터져버릴 겁니다! 만일 당신이 폴란드에 있는 모든 자유의 투사들을 체포할 작정이라면, 여기 있는 대표단도 모두 체포해야 할 겁니다. 왜냐면 나는 독일인에 맞서 싸우지 않았던 폴란드 남자가 있었다고 생각하지 않기 때문입니다! 이것만큼은 받아들일 수 없습니다, 슈미트 씨. 정말 받아들일 수 없습니다!" 그는 독일 대표단 쪽으로 몸을 기울여 포효했다. 슈미트는 관자놀이를 주물렀다. 두통이 오고 있었다. 그리고 이 회담이 끝날 때까지 두통이 나아지기나 할까 하는 질문이 머리 속에 떠올랐다."

"-하지만 우리는 독일인들이 폴란드에서 가지는 과도한 특권에 대해서만 말했습니다. 우리가 논의하지 않았던 것은 폴란드인의 권리입니다. 구체적으로는 얼마나 그 권리가 제한되어 있는지 말입니다."\n\n바호비아크가 폴란드인들이 제한받고 있는 것들의 목록을 읽어나가자, 슈미트는 속으로 생각을 시작했다. 다시 한번 그가 이 일을 시작한 이래로 그토록 혐오했던 것에 대하여 또 다른 폭발이 일어날 가능성이 있었다. 바로 뉘른베르크 법이었다. 이는 반드시 없어져야만 하는, 독일의 발목에 걸린 구시대적인 사슬이었다. 그 어떤 경우에라도, 그는 이 법을 폐지하는데 주저하지 않았을 것이다. 하지만 지금은 어찌해야 하는가? 뉘른베르크 법은 독일이 폴란드인을 어떻게 대우해야 하는지에 대한 주된 법적 지침이었다. 그러한 대규모 변화는 분명 슈페어가 알고 싶어할 것이며, 그리고 이는 슈페어의 뒤를 받쳐주는 것이었다. 그는 이 문제에 관해 슈페어가 어떤 입장을 가지고 있는지 몰랐고, 얼마나 그가 슈페어를 개인적으로 싫어하는지와 상관없이 슈페어는 슈미트의 일자리를 쥐고 있는 사람이었다. 슈페어에게 너무 심하게 반기를 드는 것은 해고를 의미할 수도 있었다. 슈미트는 결코 그런 일이 일어나길 원하지 않았다.\n\n"따라서, 슈미트 씨. 묻겠습니다-" 바호비아크는 슈미트의 머리를 향해 과장되고 침착한 비난의 손가락을 가리키며 말을 끝냈다.

"상황은 대단히 심각한 쪽으로 변화하고 있습니다." 그는 덴마크인들이 처하고 있는 위험을 강조해야만 했다. 그들이 저질렀던 실수와 다름없는 것들이 곧 무덤이나 마찬가지이며, 강력함보다는 절망과 체념만을 보여주며 죽어간다는 것이다. "라이히는 왜 우리가 유럽의 주인인지 보여주는 것이 두렵지 않습니다." 이 문장은 확실히 그들의 주의를 끌게 되리라. 더 나아가, 그는 게르마니아를 괴롭히고 있는 타락이란 존재하지 않음을 입증해야 했다. 무엇보다 슈페어가 덴마크를 아인하이츠팍트에 가입시키길 원했다면, 그는 그들의 좋은 면을 얻기를 원했을 것이다. 그렇다면...\n\n"...오래 전 우리가 위대한 승리를 겪은 이래로, 우리는 다음 세대가 올 때까지 이어질 라이히를 건설했습니다. 이는 역사상 유례가 없는 일입니다. 고대의 제국들, 이를테면 아케메네스 페르시아, 로마제국, 프랑크 왕국, 대영제국, 그들은 모두 공통적으로 하나의 치명적인 결점을 공유하고 있었습니다. 그들은 무기의 힘에 의존했으며, 국민들의 힘에 의존하지는 않았습니다. 하지만 우리는 하나의 대의 아래 통합되어 있습니다. 따라서 덴마크 국민 여러분들이 자신의 위치를 이해하는 것은 반드시 이뤄져야 합니다."\n\n여기서 슈페어는 도박을 저질렀다.\n\n"라이히의 힘은 견줄 곳이 없습니다. 그 규율잡힘은 비견할 적수가 없습니다. 우리는 국방군의 힘을 완전히 여러분들의 국가에 투입하기를 원치 않습니다. 그것은 파멸만을 가져오기 때문입니다. 대신 우리는 여러분들이 두 가지 일을 해내기를 요구합니다. 첫째, 덴마크 정부는 코펜하겐 쿠데타 시도와 연관된 모든 사람들을 석방하십시오. 그들이 독일인이든 덴마크인이든 어떠한 폭력적 행위에 대해서도 안전을 보장받아야 합니다. 둘째, 덴마크는 아인하이츠팍트에 가입하십시오. 다른 일반적인 구성국들과 동등하게 대우받을 것입니다. 특별 회원국으로 가입할 수 있었던 기회는 이제 지나갔습니다. 이제 여러분들께 선택지는 하나밖에 남지 않은 것입니다.""

"근데 이유가 뭡니까?"\n\n간수는 무기력함과 혐오스러움이 섞인 표정으로 프레데릭을 쳐다보았다. "좀 직설적으로 말하자면, 당신네 총통이 당신을 석방하고 아인하이츠팍트에 가입하지 않으면 우리나라를 침공할 거라 협박했소." 프레데릭은 여기서 경멸하는 표정을 감지할 수 있었다. "이제 당신이 행복하길 바랍니다." 간수는 문에 열쇠를 꽂아넣으며 말했다. "나가십쇼." 문이 끼익하고 열렸다.\n\n경비대에게 구타받고 싶지 않다는 그의 바람으로 빠르게 적응한 그는 크게 웃음소리를 내보았다. 프레데릭은 새로운 사람이 되었음을 느끼며 밖으로 걸어나갔다. 하지만 그가 차단기 너머로 첫 발걸음을 내딛었을 때 마음 속에 떠오른 한 가지 생각이 있었다."

"인생이... 원래... 이런... 거지." 그는 기침을 하며 말했다. 프레데릭은 나무 바닥을 내려다보면서 스스로 웅얼거렸다. "인생은 나에게 명예훈장도 주지 않을테지. 이제 이 망할-"\n\n총알자국으로 벌집이 된 문을 쾅하고 여는 소리가 들렸고 그는 공포에 질려 팔짝 뛰었다. 손은 그의 권총에 갔고 독일식 억양을 듣자마자 동작을 멈췄다. "프레데릭 씨?" 목소리가 그를 불렀다. "차가 막 도착했습니다. 즉시 떠나는 것을 권고드립니다. 어느 악한 요원이 프레데릭 씨가 타고 있는 차에 총질을 할 위험을 감수하고 싶지 않으시다면 그러는 편이 나을 겁니다." 그 말은 프데레릭이 일어나며 웃음을 짓게 만들었다. 하지만 그는 계속해서 안전하게 있기 위해서 한 편에 권총을 계속 가지고 있었다. "내가 걸어나갈 때 덴마크인들이 더 이상 겁을 주지 않았으면 좋겠어." "아니, 그들은-- 이보세요, 프레데릭 씨. 여태까지 기울이신 노력을 찬사받기를 원하시다면, 게르마니아로 돌아가는 와중에 충분히 그럴 시간이 있을 겁니다." "알았어, 알았어."\n\n이제 한때 폭력이 지배하고 있었던 코펜하겐의 도로를 내달리는 것은 이상한 기분이 들게 했다. 도시의 중심부 주변에서 프레데릭은 무엇이 일어났는지를 확실히 깨달을 수 있었다. 다 망가진 무기를 들고 피로 흠뻑 젖고 불에 탄 시신들을 쉬이 볼 수 있었고, 전투 지역이었던 몇몇 곳도 지나야 했다. "그리하여, 내가 본국에 도착하면 내 노력에 대한 정당한 보상을 받을 거라고 안전하게 말할 수 있으리라 생각해." 프레데릭은 자랑스럽다는듯이 말했다. 그는 대화를 하는 도중에도 차창 밖을 내다보았다. "총통 각하께서 이 소식을 듣고 가장 기뻐하실테지. 무엇보다 봉급이 인상될 수 있을지도 몰라. 흠... 정말 그럴지도 모르지." 그는 도로의 좁은 곳에 집중을 유지하고 있던 운전사에게 말을 걸었다. "내가 집에 돌아가면 무슨 일이 일어날 거라 생각하나? 어쩌면 집에 기념품 격으로 둘 총 정도는 가지게 해주지 않을까? 아, 나는 볼트 액션 라이플이 너무 좋아. 그 총을 쏠 때 나는 소리는 너무 만족스러워, 그리고 볼트가 딸깍하는 소리란...""

"나는 내 전우들을 지키고 지원할 것이며, 의문을 가지지 않고 명령을 따를 것이다." 맹세합니다, 맹세합니다, 맹세합니다. 이내 그는 서류 읽기를 그만두기 시작했다. 그냥 그들이 요청하는 곳에다가 서명만 했다. 드디어 그는 뒷방으로 이동했다. 그곳에는 그의 군복이 그를 기다리고 있었다.\n\n뻣뻣하고 깔끔하게 접힌 회색 군복이 똑같이 생긴 다른 것들과 함께 줄 지어 진열되어 있었다. 마트호이스는 자신이 여태까지 본 것 중 가장 깔끔한 광경이라는 생각을 잠깐 했다. 그는 자신에게 맞는 군복을 하나 집어들었고, 튜닉과 바지도 집어들었다. 깨끗하고 잘 닦인 헬멧은 그렇게 그에게 잘 맞지는 않았지만, 마트호이스는 그보다 더 잘 맞는 것을 찾을 수가 없어 그냥 가지고 갔다. 모든 준비가 끝나자, 그는 방 바깥으로 자랑스레 행진하여 건물 뒤편으로 향했다. 비슷한 군복을 입은 신참들이 있었고 마트호이스는 그들 주변에 앉았다.\n\n몇 분이 지나자 버스가 사무실에 멈췄고 사람들이 그곳에 탔다. 버스가 출발하자, 마트호이스는 그가 평생 고향이라 불러온 도시를 마지막으로 바라보았다. 인생의 새로운 장이 이제 막 시작되었다."

"내가 걔한테 그렇게 가지 말라고 말했는데 걔는 결국 갔더라지. 근데 어떻게 됐는지 아시오? 내가 옳았어, 걔는 지금 그냥 집에 있소. 내가 말하는데, 군대가 예전하고 다를리가 없지, 그치?"\n\n마지막으로 몸을 끌어올리면서, 마트호이스는 벽을 밀어붙였고, 다른 쪽 땅으로 떨어졌다. 훈련 교관이 당연히 그에게 욕을 한 바가지 했지만, 그는 듣지 않았다. 담담히 갈 뿐이었다. 그는 여전히 군인이었다."

 speer_moskowien.9.d:0 "Matthäus, without really even thinking about it, hopped over the wall and began his dash down the street. He didn't hear his NCO's shouting, whether it was positive or negative. All he heard was the thump of his own heart and the crackling of a machine gun, and suddenly the ground around him exploded in shards of stone and shrapnel as bullets crackled off the road around him. He didn't care, as long as they didn't hit him. By some divine miracle, or insane luck, they didn't. Matthäus managed to slide into the foxhole unscathed, slamming into the other wall from the sheer momentum he had carried. Quickly brushing himself off, he turned to find his friend.\n\nJohan was lying in a puddle of his own blood- a puddle that was now lapping around Matthäus's boots- with the look on his face of a rapidly dying man. His uniform, sliced to rags by the shrapnel, was now damp with blood from a thousand wounds. His arm, still holding his rifle, now lay severed behind him. As Matthäus watched in horror, Johan took one last look at him,eyes wide open, before finally falling silent.\n\nMatthäus was too terrified now to even throw up. His feeling of panic, which had been so well surpressed, now exploded just as ferociously as the grenade. In a blind moment of sheer terror, Matthäus scrabbled for the edge of the foxhole, looking for any means of escape, to run away, back past his line, out of Smolensk, all the way back to his house in Fulda.\n\nThe machine gun bullets cracked against the foxhole again, and Matthäus caught a stinging reminder of why the foxhole was there when one bullet grazed his fingers, sending him tumbling back into the blood puddle. Without covering fire, there was no way he could escape alive. Matthäus sank down against a wall, his eyes drawn to the corpse of what was once his friend. He couldn't look away. All he could do was sit and stare.\n\nThis wasn't at all like his father's stories."

From there, he turned, running with his head down as he raced past corpses upon corpses. The screaming of the dying and the wounded rattled through his head as he ran, still looking for any sort of command element.\n\nFive blocks down, he stumbled into a makeshift hospital, hastily thrown together in the chaos of the fighting. He pushed through doctors tending to their patients, nurses carrying bodies off of beds and into a pile further away, and the occasionally walking wounded waiting for a table to open up. Finally, he broke free of the chaos, continuing his search.\n\nThe horrors of the battle he had fought through became more and more clear as he seemingly revisited them all on his path. On the way forward, it had been easy to ignore them, what with the battle and bullets flying everywhere. Now, on the way back, there was no haze to cover up the bodies, the blood, and the wreckage.\n\nEventually, Matthäus did find the command center. He barely even noticed himself monotonely requesting extra supplies for his position. When the commander heeded his request, sending men to relieve his unit, Matthäus hardly noticed. He instead sat down in a corner and tried to comprehend what he had seen."

The sounds of the battle roaring outside were now only muffled cracks and bangs reverberating through the walls. The house itself was dark- the electricity had been cut long ago- and the only light that filtered in came through cracks in the ceiling and walls. Matthäus's eyes strained to see clearly in the darkness as he slowly moved forwards.\n\nA whimper in the next room caught his attention, and Matthäus stopped dead in his tracks. He could hear faint breathing, labored and wheezing as it was. A small shuffle confirmed that the source of the noise was off to the right. Slowly, Matthäus steeled himself and popped around the corner.\n\nA beam of light illuminated a young Russian, no older than Matthäus himself, slick with blood. A picture lay in his right hand, a old rifle in his left. The two regarded each other for moment, neither moving a muscle, as if they shared a connection among the chaos of war.\n\nMatthäus raised his rifle and pumped six rounds into the boy, silencing his breaths. The picture fell from his hand, and Matthäus was barely able to make out the boy standing with his mother and father.\n\nMatthäus exited the house blankly, returning to the line. The Sergeant asked him if the building was clear, which Matthäus could only reply with a nod. Without another word, Matthäus returned to the line, firing the occasional shot down at the enemy."

He couldn't stop thinking about the crack of rifle fire, the screams of the wounded and dying, or the yelling of men who knew that, at any moment, they could be dead. After an hour of this torture, Matthäus resolved for another sleepless night. He quietly hopped out of his bunk, trudging to the bathroom. Perhaps he could fix himself there.\n\nOnce he got into the dim light of the bathroom, he took a long look at himself. A tired, unshaven face stared right back into his eyes. One simultaneously young in body but old in mind. Perhaps, with a few touch-ups and a good shave, he could look like the boy he once was, but one look into his own dull eyes was a surefire tell that he wasn't truly the boy from Fulda anymore.\n\nHe took a sip of water out of the sink, washing his face afterwards, before heading back to his bed. There, he lay down quietly, waiting for the sun to come up and a new day to start."

These were good people he had met- being new to Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität was quite the overwhelming experience. Matthäus had managed, but it seemed he had finally met some people he could fit in with.\n\n"So that's how high school ended for me. Matthäus, you're the new one here. What did you do before University?"\n\n"I, ah. . ." Mathaus paused for a moment. How would they react? Should he be honest? Christ, they're all looking at him now. No time to think.\n\n"I served with the Heer out east, in Smolensk."\n\nAnother moment of silence around the table- perhaps a silence for Matthäus's chances of making friends here. "Well, uh, that's interesting." said one.\n\n"Did you kill anyone?" said another, entirely too excited for the question he had asked."\n\n"What war?" said a third. Matthäus did not answer any of these questions. Instead, he picked up his bag and quickly walked out of the cafeteria. They didn't understand. Nobody here did, and nobody here ever would.

They might even cooperate with us."\n\n"Hah! Good luck with that. No Slav would embrace us."\n\n"They won't, but it's worth trying.

But when no shot rang out, when no man shouted for cover or a medic, it seemed to them that the plan was working.\n\nStill, the Germans were cautious. And when they encountered civilians, reluctant men would remove themselves from the company of their comrades and their vehicles, carrying some rations or some kind of supplies to them. Most of the time, the meetings were brief, awkward, and all too nerve wracking on everyone. But at least those ended well. The rest of the encounters were either quite wholesome or quite bothersome.\n\nThe more they moved into the heart of the native territories, the more resistance and reluctance they found. Civilians either refused to welcome them, take their supplies, or reconsider shooting them. Snipers took advantage of kind German soldiers. And officers found themselves commanding squads of men yelling for permission to shoot back.\n\nAnd understandably, the officers were not enjoying this kind of control over what they had to do on the field.

And there would be no way to refuse a hanging.\n\nBy groups, they were noosed. By groups, they were given chances to speak their last words. By groups, they were told of their crimes again. And by groups, they were dropped, their faces concealed by black hoods, their bodies suspended by the necks.

Not literally, but when it came to civilians, it had not ended with the fates of countless men, women, and children being that of permanent cessation of life.\n\nAnd that was better than nothing. That was better than any of the other alternatives. It prolonged the war, but it was better than staining the name of the Fatherland with the crimes and the bloodshed of past conflicts. It had to be. It all had to be.\n\nAnd the Fuhrer could count on it. With thanks to Speidel and to Tresckow, even as Schörner never really let that go, he could have faith in a future where Germany would be praised for its restraint and not for its barbarity. He could at least see a light at the end of the dark tunnel which it passed for choosing to intervene out there, out in the bloody East.\n\nBut with refreshing results came depressing implications. From the lieutenant up to the highest ranking officers of Germany's armed forces, especially the Heer, there was going to be hell to pay. And that was kept to their breasts privately, beneath their coats and their helmets, they all held their Fuhrer and his lackeys responsible for holding them back, for making them do nothing when they should have been free to do something.\n\n"

"My Fuhrer, I think it best that we conduct our intervention in a manner that is balanced. I do not believe that we should be too careful nor too careless."\n\nSpeer was interested, as he turned his head on his Security Minister. He looked at him steadily, thinking. "Well," he said, "what's your plan then?"\n\nSpeidel and Schörner both looked towards Tresckow; the former with hopeful eyes, the latter with fiery ones. Tresckow ignored them both and told Speer to his face, "We move at a moderate pace. We do not slow down if we don't have to and we do not force our men to move faster if the situation does not call for it. We are supposed to enter the Eastern territories with a flexible attitude and outlook."\n\nIt made sense. Speer saw that this compromise from Tresckow could save more lives than either Schörner's or Speidel's proposals. But he knew that Tresckow's was an option that would still lead to a significant number of losses. But this should serve as the one that would bleed Germany and the East less.\n\n"I see. Your idea has merit, Tresckow, and therefore...""

 speer_moskowien.22.d:0 "Nobody suspected danger. On Autobahn 95, over three hundred German soldiers and their tanks and other vehicles were well on their way to the front. They cradled their weapons and set their eyes forward or around the convoy, suspicious of the quiet Russian trees and shrubs that lined their path. They were deep in the forests now, but they heard little from the birds and the other kinds of animals that were living in them. What was going on?\n\n"Halt!" Many of the men who heard the order turned their heads. Right before their convoy, a burning carcass of a tank. The route was blocked. Then came sharp passing sounds from the left and right. Some men fell from their transports. Others dove behind large rocks or piles of dirt. A loud but brief explosion came from the back of the convoy. Then another.\n\n"Ambush! Ambush! Everyone dismount!" Officers and their noncoms hurried to get their men in order. Drivers stayed in their vehicles or abandoned them, forgetting their weapons or bringing them out. Riflemen and machine-gunners attempted to bring their sights against the enemy that was hitting them from everywhere. But they saw no Russian, only flashes of guns.\n\nScreams and shouts. Smoke from the burning vehicles. More explosions. Commands from noncoms pushing their men at the enemy. Officers on the radios.\n\nThe Germans got their minds back. They fought the Russians back. And they pushed them away from the convoy. But when they returned, they counted their losses. A dozen of their tanks and another dozen of their vehicles were lost. So many men lay on the ground or on their vehicles. This convoy had survived, but with these results, it could not go further into the East.\n\n"

 speer_moskowien.23.d:0 "The cars of the three officers managed to arrive at dusk, as Speer could still see the vastness of the heart of Germany from the window of his office. It was almost peaceful, he thought, if only he had not gotten his country into a war out in the East. Again.\n\nHe looked down at the officers and their staffs making their way quickly into the building. The Fuhrer slipped back to his seat and waited for them to come in.\n\nWhen they did, the Fuhrer almost regretted it, because he heard Schörner blowing steam at the two others who followed after him.\n\n"I told you that your pretty compromise would not work! Look at what you've gotten the men into! An ambush!"\n\nTresckow, almost red faced, his expression set in Prussian stone, brought himself to his seat without speaking to him yet. Once there, he said, "This is not mine alone to bear. It was not my only responsibility to take care of the intervention. You both are officers of our country, are you not? Why didn't you get your hand into it yourself, Schörner?"\n\nSpeidel sat by Tresckow but too was not in a good mood about it. "Does it matter now, Tresckow? Look at the situation - we have hundreds of men dead. And we have lost valuable vehicles. Why were we not trying to be careful?"\n\n"If we moved too carefully, then we would have lost more men because we would be too slow!"\n\n"Gentlemen, enough." Speer stood up, getting the three to rise up from their seats too. "I know all of you are not in good spirits because of what happened, but if we let this stay over our heads, then there is no solving it." He now sat down, letting the others do so too. He looked at them all then said, "For now, listen. I know that you all have given the appropriate instructions for your people to take care of the survivors. I know that this probably deserves retaliation. But we also know that we have families now without their loved ones."\n\nThe officers nodded. They understood. And Speer now gave his order...\n\n"

 speer_moskowien.24.d:0 "The Fuhrer and his Security Minister shoved themselves into the car, leaving one of the homes they've visited today. They waved farewell to the family that welcomed them, seeing their faces, some of them still with red eyes and tears going down their cheeks, handkerchiefs wiping them away, for the last time. For now.\n\nSpeer sighed as he looked away, Tresckow glanced at the Fuhrer, seeing him with a frown so deep that he almost felt like comforting the man. But he was the Fuhrer, and as an officer under him, he thought it disrespectful to try to do too much for him.\n\nThe Fuhrer himself felt his own heart come under another weight. He had visited so many families all over Germania. Later, he would have to see to the other families in the rest of the Reich. He wondered how many times he could say those words. "I'm so sorry for your loss..."\n"I regret telling you that your son has fallen in..."\n"My deepest condolences go to you and your family."\n"My sympathies are with you..."\n\nSpeer shook his head at himself, ignoring Tresckow's curious glance. The car had stopped. Tresckow reminded him as the Fuhrer stepped out, "This is the Kraus family. The soldier...he had-"\n\n"A pregnant wife and two daughters. I know." He turned to one of his escorts, who had left the car before he did, "Do we have the..." The escort nodded, looking up at the windows of the house. The Fuhrer followed as did Tresckow.\n\nFrom there, the silent eyes of the woman observed them. She seemed to tremble as she looked down at them.\n\nSpeer held his eyes up then sighed, reached for his hat, and took it off his head. Then he lowered his gaze and walked to the door and knocked gently. He waited for the woman to come down and open the door. When he saw her face, Speer thought he had seen the face of his own wife, in the same manner this woman showed her inevitable grief.\n\n"

 speer_moskowien.25.t:0 "The Strike on Novgorod."
 speer_moskowien.25.d:0 ""Play the tape." The Fuhrer sank into his chair, his own eyes observing the events unfolding on the monitor. The tape has been delivered to the war room just after the results from the authorized strike on Novgorod was accomplished. With Speidel and Schörner watching it with him as the planes finally came over the city and released their bombs, flying away in another direction after great balls of fire and heat burst out of the places in the city where the bombs landed.\n\nAnother flight of planes came over, taking turns in dropping bombs that split into smaller ones. The smaller ones scattered more easily over the city, obliterating those that were not on fire or else driving more of the flames into the rest of the area.\n\n"This is insane," Tresckow spoke, drawing Speer's eyes from the monitor. The Prussian was shaking his head, his eyes filled with dread and regret.\n\n"We have to do this," The Fuhrer said with resignation. His eyes returned to the monitor, ignoring Tresckow's following words.\n\n"As if we do not have any other choice! This isn't how we are supposed to respond to the enemy's forces! We're just killing civilians!"\n\n"What does it matter? Civilians are helping the enemy fight us off and kill our men. They deserve it, Tresckow," Schörner stated. Speidel said nothing, merely shaking his head.\n\n"It's still unnecessary! And it stains our honor as soldiers of Germany! This isn't the kind of war we should fight."\n\n"It is now," The Fuhrer said, "because this is the best way we can show force against the Slavs for what they've done."\n\nSchörner smiled. But Tresckow refused to let it go.\n\n"I will not stand for this. This is just not the right way of war. I will not have it, my Fuhrer. You must not let this happen! You should have not listened to him!"'\n\nThough he glared at Schörner, the Fuhrer said nothing. Speidel turned to him and told him, "What is done is done. We can't stop it now."\n\n"It could have been avoided. It could have been left undone." Tresckow then turned away, leaving the war room, slamming the doors behind him.\n\n"

 speer_moskowien.26.t:0 "The Slow Halt"
 speer_moskowien.26.d:0 "The war is slowing down," Speidel noted, "and the casualties are picking up." He sighed at himself. He put away the papers he got from an aide. He looked up to the others.\n\n"The enemy is still not giving up the fight." The Fuhrer's eyes were on the map. He crossed his arms and shook his head. "No matter how careful we are, this whole thing is coming to a halt."\n\n"If you only just listened to me and kept going, we would have won this whole thing," Schörner boasted.\n\nTresckow glared at him and said, "We could lose more men if we force them to go into the jaws of the Russian resistance. Do you want them to go in there like blind men?"\n\n"Well, our soldiers are not blind, are they?" Shorner shot back.\n\n"Enough," Speer told them, his eyes remaining on the map, studying the lines and the units arranged for them all to see. He sighed at himself and said, "Things are not going according to plan. This intervention is not going to be done within the time we wanted it to be done."\n\n"I'm afraid that is so, my Fuhrer."\n\n"

 speer_moskowien.27.t:0 "Operation Gefrierender Sturm"
 speer_moskowien.27.d:0 ""Fuhrer," Schörner interrupted, drawing glares from the two other officers who wanted to speak, "if you want a quick end to this war, then you should forget about restraining the men. Focus on giving them the freedom to maneuver and to engage the enemy!"\n\nSpeer frowned. "Schörner, I know I am interested in a swift end to the bloodshed, but if we do that..."\n\n"If we do that, we save more lives - German lives! We should not care too much about the casualties of those causing trouble for our Fatherland in the East. Away with them, the pests!"\n\nTresckow turned to Speer as Speidel too scowled at the man. But Speer kept his attention only towards Schörner, hating him for what he suggested. He had a point, but what about our reputation? "What you suggest is as terrible as committing the same methods our men once used in the West Russian War and before! Are you not aware what you are risking with, Generalfeldmarschall?"\n\nThe determined army officer just shrugged at the Fuhrer and gestured towards the maps, especially to the units displayed. "I only suggest what works. It is better than delaying our men, delaying their support, and above all, delaying Germany's hand in saving our settlers. Is that not our purpose?"\n\nThe other two now turned to Speer, who still maintained a disgusted expression against Schörner. Not only was he suggesting a nightmare for Germany's morality, his disdain for the man in charge was coming clear. And the Fuhrer clenched his jaws and turned to the maps. Only he could decide what do with his forceful suggestion.\n\n"
 speer_moskowien.27.a:0 ""I will wash my hands of this. If you want a quick end, do it yourself. I will not have to coat my hands in blood here. I will not let innocents die because we want a quicker end to a war."

 speer_moskowien.28.d:0 "The German forces approached the quiet settlement. Shimsk was what it was called. No longer.\n\nIn the sight of the rising sun, the morning gave the Germans the advantage in surprise and in time. Tanks and men were converging on the unsuspecting people as they woke up and came out of their houses or returned from fishing at the lake. With ruthless rapidity, the cannons sounded, delivering shells that collapsed and burst buildings apart, pieces flying in all directions as machine guns and grenades did the job of murdering men, women, and children.\n\nIntelligence had suspected enemy forces here, and the Germans sought it out, but found nothing, but they could not stop, so they kept hammering the small town.\n\nAgain and again, the Germans landed blow after blow against it. And as they did, the people attempted to flee. They ran to the boats and when those were destroyed, they swam into the lake. Others ran out of the town, chased down by troops and vehicles, crushed by treads or by wheels, shot in the back if they were too slow or slipped into the ground.\n\nThe wounded who dared to crawl away or limp behind some rubble were bayoneted or finished off with pistols. Nobody the Germans found was spared.\n\nBut the Russian earth would not hide the secrets of the invaders. Even if they attempted to, the ground would spit them out, disgusted and horrified...\n\n"

 speer_moskowien.29.t:0 "No Fighting in the War Room."
 speer_moskowien.29.d:0 "What have you done, Schörner?!" The Fuhrer glared down at the bloodthirsty officer. He was clenching his fists and keeping them on the table, leaning forwards, his own words coming out of his lips with terrible indignation.\n\n"I only did what you have ordered me to do. You have given me the-"\n\n"I do not want you to use that as an excuse! You cannot tell me that you let our forces massacre an entire settlement of Russian civilians because of what I permitted you to do. I permitted you only to engage the enemy." The Fuhrer now clapped his right hand, open now, down on the table, startling those who passed by and saw this unfold. "But what you did is beyond engaging the enemy!"\n\nSchörner stared his superior down and stood his ground at the table. "Intelligence reported that-"\n\n"No," said Tresckow, intelligence was incorrect. They gave you another target. But you ignored that. What you've done is a grave error on your part, not theirs."\n\nSpeidel now spoke up, to support Speer and Tresckow, "You also ignored statements by your own reconnaissance that no enemy resistance was found in the town. Evidence was laid down in front of you again and again but you did not respond. You ignored what they said. You set aside all the warnings!"\n\n"Would you rather I let that town come under Russian control? You don't know what's on the ground!" Schörner now pointed at Speidel, rudely so. "Why don't you try to see what happens when we don't make sure of what is there in the town or not?"\n\n"So you admit you destroyed it?" Speer asked sharply, a revolted smile on his face. "Well? You've done it. You've killed men, women, and children that had nothing to do with our enemy!"\n\n"I did what I had to do. I don't care what you all say! This is necessary. It will end the war in shorter time than-"\n\n"Than what? That is foolishness, Schörner!" Tresckow shook his head at him and turned away.\n\nSpeidel crossed his arms and stepped closer to Schörner. The man reacted by pushing him away, provoking his counterpart to grapple him. But before things could escalate, the Fuhrer said, "Enough! This is the war room! Behave yourselves!"\n\nWhen everyone had calmed down, the Fuhrer sighed as he came to think about what to do. He looked up after thinking over it and announced his decision.\n\n"

 speer_moskowien.30.d:0 "A small detachment on reconnaissance was cut off from command. It lost contact several hours before it drew close to the town. It only regained contact as it moved closer to it, requesting air strikes from nearby jets sent out from the nearest available airbase, in order to destroy with extreme prejudice a large opposing force present in the town. Such strikes destroyed the majority of the town, with reports from the detachment detailing both the elimination of the enemy and of unfortunate civilians.\n\nThat was supposed to be the story. And that will have to be the story. It is important for us to control the flow of events and the validity of such events. As soldiers of the Reich, we cannot allow the truth to become a tool for our enemies to use against us. Therefore, to prevent anyone and everyone else from learning about the blunder of our troops against the town of Shimsk, we will have to be careful in establishing a cordon around information that comes out about it."

In other words, nobody really knew what was the truth about Shimsk and nobody really found out. When they tried, there was only rumor after rumor, a trail made even more confusing by the back and forth comments and conclusions made by both the military and the government. And even German media wasn't sure of what they were doing.\n\nOnly those perceptive enough realized they were being distracted by the fog of misinformation and bureaucracy. And with the fog, the truth was to be lost in the massive machinery of both the state and its sword."

Her road now was lined with the bodies of men, women, and children, of those who fought for the Fatherland or for their Motherland.\n\nIt was a terrible price to pay. It was supposed to be avoidable, but like any mistake, like any error, it was no longer avoidable once it was done.\n\nThe world returned to their opinion of Germany. In the light, Germany still was a horrible European power that used force to put down threats to herself. And Speer, looking back at it, felt a long sigh shudder out of his lungs. The regrets weighed on him. Banished in pain, his heart burned as strongly as it burned when the war ended.\n\nFeeling lost, he closed his eyes, hoping to sleep and forget about such memories. He hoped in himself that he would not have to make the same mistakes that led to such an unfortunate end. And he hoped that Germany would someday be able to cleanse herself of the blood she had spilled in the past and in the war that came after.\n\n"

 speer_moskowien.35.d:0 "The poorly built train provided no comfort for the Oberleutenant, as while the train whipping back and forth was usually no issue for supply shipments, personnel had been a different story. Not to mention the freezing temperatures that had plagued every one of the advisors as they prepared to reach Reichskommissariat Moskowien. But, as the Oberleutenant knew, comfort wasn't the priority of the Reich, was it? The train coming to a screeching halt painted a picture of his platoon's desperate stand at Bremen while he fought for Speer's succession. Exiting the train, he took one last look at his pocketwatch containing a picture of his wife before stepping off.\n\nThe rumbling of the train made it hard to hear anything else, but for the Oberleutenant, the marching of boots managed to triumph the surrounding area, as more and more soldiers within Moskau prepared themselves through the bustling streets, as if the whole city was on the move. "Oberleutenant Vogt?" called a distant voice, grasping the Oberleutenant's attention as he came to see a young Leutenant saluting him. "At ease, Leutenant. You're here to bring me to my station, correct?" Vogt said. "Aye, sir, please, follow me, sir." prompting the young officer to face about and begin walking alongside Vogt. Everywhere Vogt looked, he only realized that the chaotic mess was growing, as dirtied Aryan settlers hurried to earn a few extra Reichsmarks whilst platoons of the Reichskommissariat's soldiers marched past. "Poor bastards never had it this hard, did they?" Vogt asked. "Not exactly, sir, preparations for a possible assault by the Russians has shaken up the lives of everyone in the settlement, though everyone is hopeful for the advisors that have come in." The prevalence of such "hope" did not appear evident for Vogt as he saw scared German children and fathers having to say one last goodbye before hurrying off with a rifle in tow.\n\nEventually, Vogt managed to escape the chaos-ridden frost as he entered his small office room within one of the military installations of Moskowien. To say that the ones present during the civil war in Germany were better was an overstatement, with staff tripping over themselves, rats scurrying down the hallways, and barely enough room to stand in. "Sir, command has issued that advisors are to aid in the training of divisions newly formed in the wake of the possible attack from the natives.

Breathe out. Fire. Reload, rinse, and repeat. Fix bayonets if the enemy got any closer. Had it not been that easy to operate the weapons left from the Second World War to prepare the Reichskommissariat for such an attack like this? Apparently fucking not, according to Vogt, given how this morning has gone so far. Fighting and killing fellow Germans felt easier than dealing with this catastrophe.\n\nIt was four in the morning when the battalion he had been assigned to start off with were finished lining up, with some of the men obviously not knowing what standing at attention meant. Lighting his cigarette, Vogt yelled out, "Men, my name is Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt. As I have seen blood spilt within our homeland through war, so too now do the Russians seek to spill our blood to retain their damned power, looking to unite against our families, our Fatherland! And as proud Germans seeking to do their homeland proud, we cannot allow this. Today begins your training for when you face the frontlines, in the reality of which some of you will die. However, that is not the concern now. Today, you shall become true workers of the Reichskommissariat, true soldiers, and true Germans. Now, first platoon of the first company, mount the firing range."\n\nVogt's inspiring words seemingly died in his eyes as the men lined up for weapon training. Some of these men hadn't touched a rifle in years, while others hadn't done so at all, and only worked the farms while producing large families, as the Reich had given permission to do so. None had known the true brutalities that were to come, as Vogt had seen during the civil war, especially when some of them barely figured out how to slide the bolt open. However, the worst came when the men had finally regularly begun firing at the targets when a shower of blood splattered across the field, some staining Vogt's coat, with screaming following. Men rushed over, and saw one that one of the recruits shot themselves in the hand, nearly blowing it off; however, despite the horrificness of the situation, the man managed to retain as much composure as he could, even firing off a joke or two in the process.\n\nVogt knew the truth of the situation: the man shot himself in order to get out of service, in order to escape the horrors that everyone else was bound to endure. Yet, the Oberleutenant knew the truth of it all, that he couldn't shatter the mens' spirits knowing they had cowards in their ranks, and chose to send him away to deal with later. Afterwards, the men along the firing line simply stared at Vogt."

 speer_moskowien.37.d:0 "The Eagle, a bird of prey that overlooked the lands of the Germans for centuries. In times past, it represented the strength of the empires long past within German history, having served as a symbol of perseverance and courage. Now, as Vogt knew all too well, the symbol flew as to represent the Fatherland, along with the battalion of conscripts and volunteers within the newly formed "Adlersgruppe," charged with protecting their friends and families from the Russian onslaught that inevitably stormed its way forward. As the men continued setting up defenses in some backwater village to the south of Moskau, they continuously talked about potentially being called heroes on their return home. The word "hero" brought a whiplash of pessimism for Oberleutenant Vogt, nearly distracting him before the sounds of one of the infantrymen being torn apart by submachine gun fire exploded out.\n\nA period of shock-ridden silence boomed, until screams in Russian came from across the town, and the Germans hurried to their assigned positions, with Vogt's orders starting to become drowned out by the incoming gunfire. Chunks of concrete came flying off of surrounding buildings, some even tearing apart the faces of the new recruits, as they continually battled in the streets, with bullets flying and the blood of both Germans and Russians showering the air in a flurry of fire and gore. Vogt had known the terror of guerilla warfare for years, and now, as a Russian truck with a light-machine gun in the bed firing down into the Germans, Vogt had the chance to utilize his experience. With cries drowning the air, Vogt shouted at some of the closest men to him, "Find your strength men, now's our time to make the advance! Unteroffizier Breiner, take some men and gather the explosives! Unteroffizier Kranz, gather some men with me and we'll surround the truck, it cannot-" a bullet interrupted Vogt's speech as a rain of gunfire forced him to find better cover. As he regained his defense, the only thing the Oberleutenant saw when he laid his eyes on his men were the same emotions portrayed by his brothers-in-arms during their time fighting for Speer back in Germany. The same emotion that came as the feelings of heroism faded, and the chilling shadow of death crept closer and closer, with every comrade lost to another bullet, whether it's fired from a Russian or a German.\n\nTerror.\n\nWiping his face some more, Oberleutenant Vogt shouted "Fall back, fall back! We'll find another way around!" as the German soldiers began to retreat in the face of the overwhelming firepower from the Russians. They may not be heroes, but they didn't need to be heroes to deserve to live another day, to Vogt, anyway."

But Vogt could never have expected the brutalities to rise so quickly: the amount of mass executions, the killings of deserters, those once considered to be comrades in fighting against the Russians, the viscera, all had come crashing down upon the volunteers in such a short period. Much to the respect of Oberleutenant Vogt, while it all seemed difficult, the men continued to march forward past it all; that is, until the Burning of Ryazan.\n\nAs the Adlergruppe marched southwards from Moskau, pushing deeper into Russian territory "in the defense of the Reich's' rightful territory,'' the men had already become surrounded as the urban battle exploded. Sure, the men got their first taste of battle in a village, but this was an entirely different story as the concrete buildings and structures hid enemy Russians behind every corner. Constantly, squads of enemy soldiers seemed to appear as phantoms in the dark, pinning a few squads of the Germans down before they finally dealt with the issue. This was, until Alpha Company, led by Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt, entered the courtyard of an apartment complex to secure the area, and became pinned down by heavy enemy fire from all sides of the three-sided building. The men rushed to cover or died trying to do so, with the screams of fellow Aryans dying in the stony courtyard filling the air, as what seemed like the endless Russian supply of lead came raining hell upon the company. Vogt was left with no other choice but to hold out as he continuously pleaded for air support from local German air wings, who promised "immediate combat support."\n\nIt took a seemingly endless five minutes for the screams of the German jets to overtake the slaughter, as the Gates of Hell seemed to open up from the heavens above and consume the apartment complex. The men watched along in horror, some trying to get up and move as the fiery napalm they pleaded for arrived, sticking to the enemy soldiers who threw themselves off the multiple story balconies to escape the horrid fate of burning to death. However, as Vogt thought the horror was over, it only multiplied in size, as the outer doors of the apartment complex opened up and a flood of burning men, women, and children came screeching out of the complex. Only some had been armed, but none cared any longer, as they peeled away at the flesh and bone that melted away from the deadly German napalm, with mothers holding their children, hoping for an end to the madness. Eventually, all had either died from the flames or were killed out of mercy by some of those within the Aldersgruppe, who had all seemed to shock and terrified to be able to respond to any other orders from some of the superiors.\n\nThe nightmares that night consumed Vogt's mind. Flashbacks to that last stand at Bremen stormed his mind only to reach a burning conclusion, with the flooding of anachronistic burning children and women into the once-heroic battlefield, causing the Oberleutenant to rocket from his dreams every hour of the night."

All had such beautiful, loving wives, and even more beautiful children, in the eyes of Marina, always longing to start a family with her husband. Finally, the glowing numbers of "418" came into view with a screeching halt, and she excitedly danced over, finally seeing her beloved Marzell come into view. She immediately rushed to embrace her Marzell, who jumped at the sight of his rushing wife, causing her confusion, saying, "You're finally back, Marzell! Come here!" she said, embracing her husband. "Yes, I'm, I'm home now." Marzell said, as Marina felt her husband's hand shake.\n\nHours had gone by, and yet, the newly returning husband still remained...odd, according to Marina. Everytime a new question came forward, like, "How did it feel to serve the Fatherland once more?" he simply responded with a quick "It was good." or "Great." She couldn't name the look in his eyes, one of distance, as if his eyes were a camera out of focus, but she simply tried to provide everything she could to be a good wife. That evening, as the couple climbed into bed, Marina's attempts to embrace and comfort her husband resulted in a simple repulse on the side of her husband, followed by his attempts to get some sleep as he tossed and turned in the bed.\n\nLater into the night, Marina woke to the sound of broken glass and an otherwise empty bed, as she threw off the covers and rushed towards the kitchen, where she heard the loud noise. Realizing her husband was nowhere in sight, she grabbed a letter opener they kept on the desk before entering the kitchen...where she found her husband, with glass shards shattered across the table and ground, whiskey, which her husband swore to never drink in his career, spilled across the area, and a bloodied hand carrying a pistol kept from service. Marina dropped the letter opener on the ground as she approached her husband, asking "Marzell, oh god, what's wrong?" Marzell responded with nothing, only beginning to sob into her chest as he dropped the pistol on the ground, and embraced her tightly, shaking all the while."

And within one small compartment, the bustling and rocking of the powerful locomotive hardly shook the work Walther Viktorow had prepared. Viktorow sat excitedly, tapping on his briefcase filled with documents and procedural forms as he stared out into the Western Russian wilderness, completely losing track of the outside world as the train came to a screech, and the city streets filled his view. Finally, after so much wrongdoing against the harrowed Russian, Viktorow knew that the time had come to make a difference in the world, even if the greatest trial awaited him, and he had one thought which dominated his mind:\n\nMoskau awaits.\n\nHowever, as Viktorow exited the train, accompanied by a group of German guardsmen straight from Germania, the full force of the trial would strike as he looked around the train station. Everywhere, men, women, and children, all with bright, beautiful blue eyes, and adorned with flowing golden hair, all looked as if they had come from a German slum. Exhaustion colored their faces while callouses covered their hands, with some appearing frail and hungry, and all adorning ragged clothes that would bring disgust to most German higher ups. But Viktorow did not want the prestige or class of higher up, this is exactly what Viktorow wanted, even if he could not stand the pleading eyes of the settlers here. At the end of the day, they were the Reich's citizens, and as proud as they may be, they were suffering, and Viktorow knew that he, as an ambassador on behalf of the Reich itself, he could not allow this any longer.\n\nAs the snow landed atop his cap, the toy of a young child bounced across the street in front of the capitol, nearly prompting a guard to strike the child, were it not for Viktorow's intervention. Handing the child his toy from next to Viktorow's feet, the diplomat said a few simple words to the boy: "Do not be afraid, things will change here soon." as he looked onwards to the capitol building of Reichskommissariat Moskowien, as the recent clashings of Germans and Russians flooded his mind."

Improvements regarding the stability of the transportation systems between the Reich and the Reichskommissariat could potentially be looked into; however, if anything, the difficulty presented in the transportation systems is a small look into the situation within Moskowien. Politically, the situation within the area appears stable enough to not withdraw supply efforts towards the settlers of the area, nor do any reports indicate a collapse for the Reich's influence within the area around Moskau; however, living standards have fallen dramatically for the Aryan settlers within the Reichskommissariat as well as native Russians. Outbreaks of conflict between native Russian populaces and the settlers arriving from Germany proper has caused considerable detriment for German settlements, and Russians within the area have suffered as well, despite the advancements made within the area. In this regard, although living conditions have plummeted for all parties within Moscowien and the surrounding Russian nation-state, the populace has espoused supreme loyalty towards the Reich itself, and in an effort to support the German and the Russian within the area, the developing situation has been taken with the greatest priority for our diplomatic envoy. Thus, actions towards the advancement of OPERATION: GREATWHITE will begin immediate implementation within the interactions between Reichskommissar Kasche's successor, native leadership within the newly established state for Russians outside of Reichskommissar Moscowien, and the diplomatic envoy you have assigned me to, and transportation to the capital of the nation-state of the Russians will be arranged to aid our mutual efforts through a hopeful admittance into the Unity-Pakt.

Viktorow knew that as the days went on, the time before he'd venture forward to meet with the officials of the Russian nation grew shorter and shorter; yet, despite his excitement for the eventual departure and work, everything left him confounded in the reasoning behind the excitement.\n\n"Excuse me, Dr. Viktorow, but the convoy has been prepared for transportation," a young secretary said as he had missed her knocks on the door.\n\n"My apologies, Miss Berchow, right away," the diplomat said, as he grabbed his suitcase and followed her out. Everything around him had showcased what he enjoyed, the order, the structure of it all, and now was finally his time to make a difference. Time to make a difference that his predecessors of the past did not, he continued, thinking of the pictures of his family he kept so neatly tucked away back home in Germania. The carvings of the beautiful little box delighted Viktorow, in contrast with the contents, as he saw capturings of the times of a Russian family working its hardest to get through the wall set up by German forces. How great the suffering his grandparents had faced as they crossed over into the new land of Germany, and the dreaded persecutions that the Viktorovs faced being foreign immigrants in a hostile land. But no more, no more crushed dreams nor broken souls from either side, as each and every hardworking German and Russian around Moskowien has earned their right to support from the Fatherland, and earned an end to the troubles which plagued them.\n\nViktorow continued his thoughts as he finally made it outside the capital alongside his fellow statesmen and the Waffen regiment accompanying them deep into the Russian land. The frost encapsulating the trucks reminded Viktorow of his grandfather and grandmother as the convoy began to move away from Moskowien territory."

As the entourage continued onwards, the silence slowly transformed from an excited admiration of the Russian land to a dreaded silence, with each rotation of the tires bringing another wave of confusing tensions as the Waffen guards present in Viktorow's truck prepped themselves. It was confusing to Viktorow, to say the least, until the trucks finally passed through the iron gates of the city.\n\nThere, peering through the windows of a heavily armored truck, Viktorow, for the first time in his life, received a glimpse as to what his grandmother and grandfather escaped all those years ago: the glimpses of children roaming the streets without parents in sight, in rags, fighting over a piece of bread which had been stained by the mud of the ground. Across the street, Viktorow caught glimpses of three men beating another fellow Russian on the ground, pummeling him with bats, punches, and kicks as they strip him of his bag and coat and duck off into the alleyway, passing by a duo of nurses carrying a body covered with a tarp out of a health center. The homeless had grown in number as he saw groups of armed men harassing a young woman coming out of her home, seemingly asking for overdue money owed to them, and Viktorow could only pray for her safety as the convoy moved on. Viktorow continued to think and debate with himself as to what had become the fate of the Russian people, what could have done this? Were the politicians in charge of the state that greedy, or was there some sort of crisis causing all of this? Viktorow continued to pray for the hope that things had not been completely this way for his ancestors.\n\nAs the motorcade came to a halt outside of the capitol building, Viktorow continued to dust himself off and grab his briefcase as his eyes locked onto a peculiar sight: a little girl, no older than seven, grabbed at the chain link fence as she continued to stare at the Germans inside. She looked thinly, and had only dirty rags on, yet her brown eyes glimmered in the snow, reminding Viktorow of the daughter he always wanted.

He stared into seeming nothingness, as the words upon the transcripts laid out in front of him blurred, all the man could see was images of his days within the surrounding area. The desperateness and near predatory nature of some of the groups that had formed outside of the Moskowien territory, how could the self-governed area fall apart so quickly, yet the room he sits in remain so lavish?\n\nSuddenly, the wrinkled face of the anti-Soviet himself, Bronisalv Kaminski entered the room, offering a nod and handshake to the diplomat.\n\n"Brigadeführer Kaminski, it is an honor to meet you. My name is Dr. Walther Viktorow-" Viktorow started, before being cut off by Kaminski.\n\n"The diplomat sent by Speer, huh? We've been waiting for your arrival. What's the terms?"\n\nViktorow hadn't pictured such exhaustion from Kaminski, but then again, all of the area has been a surprise, hasn't it? Viktorow took out the first report in the file, and began discussing the Führer's desires out of Kaminski to pay for the incredible amount of support issued to the native state via the ceding of Brauchitschstadt and a swearing of loyalty to the Unity-Pakt.\n\nViktorow's seemingly hopeful words brought him to look up, only to meet the image of Kaminski hunched over the desk, both hands clasping his face.\n\n"They'll march in and hang me...joining the Unity-Pakt...the natives, they've given..."\n\nAnd finally, as if a sledgehammer broke through a castle made of sand, everything came together for Viktorow. The terms, the ceding of territory, the governmental lavishness, yet the hopeless and the butchers remaining outside, this wasn't Kaminski's misdoings: they've been paying everything towards the Reich. They couldn't stand on their own, they needed help, and now... It suddenly dawned on him: Operation: Great White. Viktorow wasn't serving as a negotiator here, he was a predator: a loan shark.\n\nIn the end, Kaminski, with eyes that seemingly had the life sucked out of them, shook to the agreement of losing Brauchitschstadt and joining the Pakt. With every step, from leaving the capitol building, to walking to the trucks, to staring out the windows as they rumbled out, Walther Viktorow felt one thing alone: the eyes of starving, broken Russians."

Meeting with BRONISALV KAMINSKI retained success within the notions outlined in OPERATION: GREATWHITE, as the native state has agreed to cede Brauchitschstadt to the direct control of the German Reich while issuing a submittance of willingness to joining the Unity-Pakt in support of Germany proper in exchange for the cancellation of debts owed from the local government towards Germania. German settlers retained celebratory feelings over the success and technical end to conflicts against their Russian neighbors, as local reports showed demonstrations of praise regarding the Reichskommissariat's government. Outside of Moskau, reports of Russian citizens' outrage over the terms of KAMINSKI'S agreement have been issued to local media outlets, with even some factions within Brauchitschstadt reporting direct obstinance towards the notions of direct annexation by the German Reich proper. Overall tension within the area remains to be seen, as continuous data has been feeding into the Reichskommissariat's office to measure the success of the terms. Within personal reason and experience, it is within bounds of my personal measures to report that OPERATION: GREATWHITE provides immediate successes for the German Reich; however, continuous documentation will be required to measure long-term successes. Insofar as measurements reach, the continuous losses of the native populaces following the Second World War, the Western Russian War, and now the loss of Brauchitschstadt and the diplomatic alignment with the Unity-Pakt may offer a fostering point for native resistances.

A pound on the door outside his office served as the fifteenth reminder that day that the world after Hitler was still a chaotic maelstrom of politics and blood, a great typhoon in which Germania was the eye of the storm. Peaceful for now, but surrounded by disorder on all sides.\n\n"Come in, come in."\n\n"Foreign minister, a report from Moskowien. I'm sure you'll find it fascinating reading."\n\n"Thank you. You're one of Gehlen's boys, with the RND?"\n\nThe young man opposite him remained silent, and smiled coldly. Schmidt internally rolled his eyes and took the paper from him. "Very well. Off you go then."\n\nWith a short bow, the man left. Schmidt stared at the paper in front of him. 'Kaminski victorious', a newspaper clipping on the front read. Ah, so old Brinislaw had won out against the German settlers. A bad situation for Germany, perhaps, what with the whole legacy of a totalitarian Reichkomissariat and all leaving a sour taste in Russian mouths. Still, Schmidt thought it was perhaps preferable to Von Dem Bach or one of the other wretched Nazis patrolling the ruins of Russia. If not for his government, then for humanity as a whole.\n\nHe filed through the papers, and one stood out particularly. An intercepted telegram, between one of Brinislaw's men and some sympathetic Russian national in Lettland. Now this was interesting. Seems Kaminski had become convinced the best way for his Moscow autonomy out of the chaos enveloping the rest of Russia was a negotiation session with Germania's finest. Perhaps Schmidt would see the best of both worlds, then."

Schleswig-Holstein, back before the Wilhelmine era, had been a land controlled by an offshoot of the Romanovs. Fate still has it that the Lord of Europe and the fractured Giant of the East will forever be woven together in a tangled tapestry.\n\nSchmidt arrived in a country town in Western Moskowien by plane. Russian troops lined the streets, eying down the foreign minister's convoy as it moved toward the central bar, which had seemingly been refitted into a political centre of operations for Kaminski's forces in this region. Schmidt was confident that he was safe; the Heer around him was equipped with better weapons than these peasant conscripts, that was for sure. Either way, blood spilled today would not be the preferable option.\n\nNegotiations were over lunch. Shashlik, Pelmeni and even Chicken Kiev. Schmidt didn't have Russian cuisine often, but it remained one of his favourites on the continent. Beyond the food, Schmidt was impressed with Kaminski. The man spoke German well, and seemed cultured in literature and philosophy, something that even in the supposed 'world capital' politicians often lacked. The man's taste was clearly in the sciences, however, but Schmidt was capable of holding basic conversation on the scientific feats of Tesla through to Braun. Schmidt liked Kaminski, and it seemed the favour was mutual.\n\nA minor tremor in the conversation was felt. Schmidt let it be known that Brauchitschstadt, or what the Russians still call 'Leningrad', would be directly administered by Germania. The city seemed to hold sentimental value to the old soldier opposite him, who had served his time with the Red Army before Stalin's purges. Lenin was still an admired figure.\n\nDespite this, Kaminski was still willing for the negotiations to move forward.

"Perhaps the Heer might take an advisory role in the new Moscow government, if you would be so willing."\n\n"I heard what you said the first time, I was just checking to see if you were the rat you appeared to be." Kaminski sighed. "You know, Schmidt, out here in the East, people call you a hero. There's optimism that you might be something different to those Nazi scum who run your country. That you might be an angel on Speer's shoulder, and you might do something genuinely good for Russia, or even the world."\n\nSchmidt watched as the man opposite him stood from his unfinished lunch. Kaminski faced away, equipping his coat as he continued. "No man is immune to propaganda. I read an American minister talk about it, and you know Schmidt, I hate the Americans, but this one had a point. 'Propaganda makes puppets of us'. It has made a puppet out of you. My blood might come from Warsaw, Minsk, and the very soil this building stands on, but do you think just because I am a Slav that I am stupid?"\n\n"Take yourself and those uptight pricks in uniform behind you back to whatever fucking hell you came from."

The bewildered old soldier was guided by the foreign minister into the party office building that had been reserved for the meeting. A table was decorated with a grand lunch for Moskowien's interim ruler. Wurst, potatoes and plenty of beer. "Schmidt, this was unnecessary. Thank you."\n\n"Anything for a fellow German on the homebound flight. Now, down to business?"\n\nAt Bach's nod, Schmidt began. With an apology, the foreign minister revealed that Bach's position would be filled by Alexis von Roenne, to which Bach was seemingly compliant. Additionally, the Reich would directly occupy Brauchistschstadt, and create a new german settler state in the Southern Volga region. To both of these territorial changes, Bach was quite amicable.

Sometimes, in Bach's weaker moments, even he doubted the party. Schmidt felt he had met a kindred spirit. The deal was sealed with signatures, and the men departed home.\n\nSchmidt didn't like night time flights, so he was staying in Lauenburg til the morning. He sat up in his hotel bed with the folder the RND had given him. It was a dossier on Bach, and although he had considered the diplomatic sections with great detail, he had only skimmed the personal section. Schmidt's eyebrows furrowed as he glanced over a section tabbed as 'Activities before Moskowien', detailing the man's actions before the war. Schmidt felt his heart race. The man he had joked and drunk with just hours earlier had been responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocents, and these were only the documented ones. In Operation Hummingbird, Bach had personally killed several in the SA. Then there was his horrific career in the SS, which Schmidt had heard of but never actively considered.\n\nNo one in this Reich was innocent. Not even the kindest of faces, or the warmest of voices. It was just Schmidt, and Schmidt alone, dancing with the murderers that had destroyed his father's country. He felt his eyes begin to tear up, but suppressed the urge to cry.

Looking with more attention, he also noticed details he had missed when looking outside in the past weeks: patchwork reparations to the roads and sidewalks, electric cables hanging from scrambled-together power lines, public phones scattered because the people had no telephones inside their homes...\n\nRight at that moment, as if to confirm that indeed, the situation was dire, all lights went out in the office, and the surprised voices from outside the door made it clear that it was a general blackout.\n\nThe Führer fumbled around to his desk, suddenly dejected, and sighed.

In a very similar room in Germania, the central hub of NetzRAM had been activated, and the network spanning the entirety of the Reich was officially active. In a few moments, a message would arrive from the main device, and the results of this first test would show whether the experiment had been a resounding success or a humiliating failure.\n\nThe screen buzzed with life, and everyone almost turned into a giraffe trying to look at the screen: letter after letter... it appeared! "WHAT IS YOUR NAME?" Cheers erupted across the room, and with trembling hand, the University dean answered: "WALTHER BOTHE". Another few seconds, then a second message: "WHAT IS YOUR QUEST?" to which the agreed-upon answer: "TO FURTHER SCIENCE". Finally, the third and last: "WHAT IS THE AIRSPEED VELOCITY OF AN UNLADEN SWALLOW?"\n\nSilence fell in the room. This wasn't the correct question! Was there a problem? A bug? A... hacker?! Then, a student asked for permission to write, and once he had it, he quickly wrote: "AN AFRICAN OR A EUROPEAN SWALLOW?" Two minutes of tense wait, until the screen finally buzzed again: "SCHEIßE!"\n\nCheers and laughs erupted once more."

Now, celebrations aside, you will be assigned a critical mission.\n\nWith the Büro Wessel under control, it's imperative that you research extensively the subverting forces that have cropped up under the new regime led by Führer Albert Speer. The first, critically, is the Antifachistische Aktion. Being one of the most vocal opponents of National Socialism, they were purported as 'exterminated' under the leadership of Führer Adolf Hitler, but unfortunately we have been mistaken. We know little of them yet, so uncovering their degenerative Bolshevik roots is important.\n\nSecondly, is the exponential ramp-up of the student movement in Germany. We have firm reason to believe that, while they are backed by Antifa, they form the backbone of the reformist movement in Germany. With this, a double-pronged problem has been formed. We do not have limitless resources - and focusing on one is better than spreading ourselves thin on both. While I advise you to focus on the former, as your first-in-command I leave the choice to you Herr Wessel..."

WHILE EXTREMELY RISKY, THIS WILL CRIPPLE THE MOVEMENT FROM WITHIN.\nTHE SECOND IS TO FRAME THE STUDENT GROUPS AS RADICALIZED BLOODTHIRSTY COMMUNISTS.

Wessel paused for a second and wondered. What on Earth made them think this was a good idea? Caution is always advised, even if you've been under the government's nose for decades. "Your mission will be as follows:\n\nAt (REDACTED) past midnight, you will infiltrate past the security in the house. You will be given significant amounts of explosives, and you will need to plant them across several weak points throughout the house. Once you have done so, you will leave the residential area and activate the explosives using a detonator that will be given to you.\nLeave no trace of your presence, as the police will be given full authority to investigate the scene in order to appease the students.

Of course it was necessary. Anything else would not be tolerated, but now the state had to deal with the fall-out that followed. At the very least it wasn't as bad as he may have initially thought, but seeing every day pop up with another article about how some pushy college student affiliated with Antifa was arrested by the men in black.

Soundlessly, the agent took a seat and waited for the first-in-command to speak. It took a few seconds before he did.\n\n"Herr Wessel, I..." He began, putting his hands together on the table. "Cannot say I'm necessarily displeased with your performance-" Wessel didn't react, but he could tell the man wasn't being fully honest when he said that. "-It's just that, ah... firstly, we lost an agent." And at that, Wessel could feel the slightest hit to his pride, but he nodded and began speaking. "The mission was incredibly risky." He admitted.

"Four agents have died during the raids. All of their deaths weigh on my shoulders," he admitted, though betrayed no emotion. "However, we've at least secured a blow to Antifa." Gehlen held up a hand and motioned for Wessel to stop speaking for a moment. "A blow that has further entrenched the core." He took in a deep breath. "Your performance has not been bad.

Eventually, the whole room was almost filled with explosives, placed carefully by gloved hands, and Agent Red repeated the steps he took before, exiting out of the house and once again narrowly escaping the vision of the guards.\n\nWhen he was out of sight, he wanted to start sprinting for his life, but relented.

He knew all too well what was going on, and certainly the rest would too, wouldn't they?! It was plain in sight, clear as day, black as night!.\n\nBut when he showed up to protest at his college that afternoon, most of his colleagues weren't around with him. Only a scant few were scattered around the campus, holding signs and waving fresh flags that spoke about the incident at the house. That would've brought him solidarity if it wasn't that so few were around to share the message. Instead, as he stood and boldly proclaimed that it was all a sham - that the investigation was a cover-up, that Albert Speer and his cronies didn't have a care in the world for the value of democracy, nobody except the allies around him listened.

Though I will say this, with your skill being pushed forwards by my brains of the operation, I am certain that we shall manage to keep Germany afloat of any of its partners." His brains...? Wessel thought that this was mostly his operation, but he decided not to speak up about it. "I hope so too, sir.

IF ALL GOES WELL, ANTIFA WILL ASSAULT THE STUDENTS, AND GERMANS ABROAD WILL SEE IT AS THEIR VIEWS BEING TOO VIOLENT AND EXTREME FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON." Wessel thought about what would happen if they simply printed information about Antifa being radical extremists. Would it work just as well? Not that he could determine that anyhow, though.\n\n"REMEMBER THE STRATEGY OF THE ROMANS - DIVIDE AND CONQUER. YOU WILL DO THE SAME HERE." Wessel let the lightest of smiles touch his lips.

Though there was something strange about the way they got all that info, and how suddenly it was, as well as how detailed it is.\n\nGiven the information, however, they had to check it out - and so the Antifa members came down to the street where the students were marching that day, and while one side met the other with warmth, it wasn't initially reciprocated. One of the Antifa members decided to pull ahead of their group and begin shouting. "Klaus Becker!" He shouted, and one of the students raised their hand, moving forward. "We're told your father is a veteran pilot in the Luftwaffe, and that you vote for the NSDAP. Are both of these things true?"\n\nThe silence was unpleasant. It was broken, however, when Klaus let out a laugh. "Who told you THAT?! My Opa is a retired electrician, and I've never touched a ballot in my life! Goodness... if you don't believe me, I'll be happy to show you my father's certificate!" That chipped off some of Antifa's initial weariness, and as more students were asked, more of these nonsensical facts were debunked. By the end of it, both sides joined each other in another, new protest, as Antifa's initial suspicions about that letter were confirmed."

While that would've been all, that day they were also tipped in about something else - by an agent from the RND, no less, about how a group of students would gather in one of these empty classrooms and manufacture their lies and fan the flames of what was going on.\n\nWhen Stefan listened in to a door on a classroom on the second floor, he could hear voices inside. With a smirk, he motioned for his fellow officers to draw their batons as he walked in first, casually opening the door to see six hooligans all gathered around a table, and their attention was turned to him and his gang almost immediately. One of them, a woman, spoke up. "Who are you?" She asked, already becoming worried. Stefan grinned. "Who do you think?" He countered. "We're the police, and we've been informed that you plot an anti-government conspiracy here."\n\nThe mood of the room darkened, and one of the other students spoke up suddenly. "Anti-government conspiracy?! We're just a bunch of students talking! That-", "Silence!" Stefan shouted, expression growing more stern. "I won't tolerate this foolishness. You're all coming with us down to the station where we can determine your loyalty." He slid his free hand against the front of the baton. "Or would you like me to show you what it means to enforce the law?"\n\nA painful silence dominated the space between the two for a few seconds, before one of the students eventually conceded, stepping out and looking frightened. "O-okay." She began. "I-I'll go. Guys?" She asked, looking back to the other who were growing steadily more concerned. "It's n-n-not like we're getting another choice."

Nevertheless, the people, although fearing the liberals lurking within the shadows, expressed genuine support for Germany, controllingly, with reverence, with genuine care and concern.\n\nHowever, the gathering of counter-protesting students continued to grow, each crying out over their cares, their damned desire to tear apart the slave system or "stop the German war machine." As the kettle of tension boiled, all it took was three squeezes of a finger to turn the situation into a disaster, as a certain Josef Bachmann, what would be another teenager joining students, shot one of the student leaders identified by the RND, Rudi Dutschke. The first bullet entered between the shoulder and throat, pushing Dutschke back before the second bullet struck, travelling along the side of Dutscke's skull and brain before the final shot tore straight into Dutscke's head, sending a splattering of blood and brain matter across the students as he fell, dead.\n\nWith a section of the guards attacking Bachmann, and Dutscke dead in the arms of his student comrades, chaos reigned. The students broke through the barriers, smashing straight into the rally as several dozen more guards rushed to the scene. Students began to beat guards over the head with clubs, bottles, and bricks, whilst guards responded with gunfire, gas, and armored vehicles.

Finally, after catching a few breaths Wessel walked in, greeted by the watchful eyes of around a dozen of Wessel's subordinates, leaders within the intelligence organization, and commanders of several agents of the RND. Some of these men had been there at Nuremberg, some of them their agents. But to Wessel, one thing remained as he walked up to the podium.\n\nNone were innocent from what happened.\n\n"It is not of my nature to scorn my men, nor render any of you all as lowly or failures. However, in addressing the events of the rally for the Reichsparteitag der Macht at Nuremberg, we must recognize a certain degree of failure amidst ourselves and our department in the handling of what happened, and our preparations for a potential conflict. Now, it is our duty to ensure that we can resolve what happened, and where to go from here." Wessel said, as his men looked around, uncomfortable. For the next hour, Wessel scorned them, ensuring each and every one that they would be responsible in the investigation of the incident, now that the world is watching them.\n\n"Herr Gehlen, I'm hoping this is a sufficient hour for you, sir." Wessel said, entering the smoke-filled office of Reinhard Gehlen. "Of course, what is it, Wessel?" Gehlen asked. "Well, sir, it's in regards to the Nuremberg incident. Bachmann's still in custody, and, quite frankly, we need to find out why he shot Dutschke, what if someone's backing him?" Wessel said. Gehlen took a long drag of his cigar, looking at his desk, before uttering with a puff of smoke, "What makes you think anyone else is involved? Could be some fucked up kid after all." "It just doesn't make sense, he's a young kid, small criminal record, doing day jobs, why on Earth would he shoot a political ideologue?" Wessel responded. With a chuckle, Gehlen said, "Huh, well, if you ask me, some of those lowlifes can get all wrapped up in the SS's business, when there's nowhere to gun, men run to the occult. I'd start your search there." Wessel was taken aback, the Ordenstaat? Would they really bother shooting a student leader, just for disagreeing? While doubt rushed to his head about Gehlen's statement, he was interrupted by a young intelligence officer slamming open the door, with an urgent look in his eyes.\n\nJosef Bachmann was found hanged in his cell.

Wessel, a skilled and experienced investigator, knew that the answers lied within the body, within Bachmann. And yet, everytime he approached the idea, bureaucratic shifts of resources and reorganizations of priorities for the department swept up any attempts.\n\nThe ever-recurring wall of smoke hit Wessel like a wave, only to calm back down and reveal the face of his ever-diligent superior. "Good evening, Herr Gehlen." Wessel greeted. "The same to you, Wessel. Now, a late hour in the night, coming into my office, what's pricked your mind tonight?" Gehlen responded. "Well, Herr Gehlen, I just have some, well, issues in the Nuremberg investigation, but I believe I have a solution. You see, I understand your hypothesis; however, it appears too convenient, or even that we may have overlooked pieces attached to Bachmann that could lead further in any direction. Nevertheless, I believe a formal reinvestigation of Bachmann's body could allow for some, well, advances. Unfortunately, the proposal has been shut down due to other matters of the office becoming, well, randomly prioritized, and I believe we need to focus the investigation." Gehlen said, squashing the cigar against the ashtray on his desk. "Bachmann had clear ties to Burgundian authorities, it's as clear as day upon the man's very clothes. You wish to tell me that it could somehow be something completely different? We have many things to worry about in the RND, reopening a closed case is not one of them, Wessel." Gehlen said, frustratingly, as he lit another cigar.\n\nFury bore into Wessel's body. How could his superior, the man he's respected for so long, suddenly act so obstinately to his pleas? This wasn't right, not at all. Lifting his office phone, Wessel said, "Wedekind...Kessler...to my office, please."\n\nThus, a plan was hatched. A plan for the agents to break into the morgue, to investigate Bachmann's corpse, pictures and all, and bring it all back to Wessel.

With all the lights in the office shut off, and all window shutters brought down against the night sky, the meeting began.\n\n"Wedekind, Kessler. I respect your commitment to the cause we have put together; however, I wish you two to know the legal ramifications of all this. This could easily be what leads us to an early death in a Germanian heavy containment facility. I will be more than happy to allow you to leave and never speak of your involvement again. Do either of you wish to do this?" With the men's eerie silence, and constant stares at Wessel, an understanding agreement was made, and the bag was unzipped to reveal the products of the break-in. Photos, documents, and physical evidence all spilled onto the table.\n\nEach of the photos revealed the harsh, red marks upon the throat, with finger marks all up and down the assassin's throat, with rough scratches and blood trickling down the corpse. Meanwhile, the autopsy report provided even more suspicion regarding the case of death for Josef Bachmann. The primary medical examiner involved in the autopsy of Bachmann had been Dr. Heinz Felfe, who had grown closer and closer to Reinhard Gehlen during his career in the RND, which brought things closer to Gehlen, of course. However, the most damning piece of information dawned in the mind of Gerhard Wessel: Heinz Felfe had been in Kyiv for a criminal autopsy.\n\n"Someone forged these documents." Wessel said, in shock.

And yet, the documents kept showing more and more proof for Wessel.\n\nAs he stared at the documents, rushes and waves of doubt filled Wessel's mind, as the typically astute, focused, and efficient man turned inwards to paranoia and fear. The man who fought so diligently beside him, as a father, Reinhard Gehlen, and yet his name was plastered all over the investigation, whilst his words covered falsified information and throw offs from the main investigation. Was it true Gehlen? No, it couldn't be, this man was loyal to the Reich, why would he throw things off for a genuinely efficient information bureau that had trusted him dearly? Wessel's minds wandered throughout the worries and doubts of the world, as his entire career up to this point became jeopardized with the notions working in the midst of treachery, while other times it proceeded to become laser-focused on the difficult matter in front of him, looking for any potential leads and openings into this dreadful case of treachery and dangers around every corner. Suddenly, the familiar smoky odor alerted Wessel as he put away the material into his desk and Reinhard Gehlen came in.\n\n"Good afternoon, Wessel. Here, you got some departmental mail regarding last month's procedures and some ways we're looking to improve, figure you may have some worthwhile input, after all." Gehlen said, flashing a smile at his subordinate before leaving. Wessel's tired, sunken eyes could hardly stand any more bureaucracy, when his hands ran along the curious material of the rubber stamp attached to the envelope. That's when an idea hatched in Wessel's mind, and he cleared through his desk to gather the documents, and each of their attached envelopes.

Why an admiral and the vice president of the RND met up was unknown to him, but he had his musings on the matter. Still, he wasn't here to spy on them. In fact, quite the opposite.\n\nIn Germany's decadence, many officials slacked on caring about having paranoia-levels of security wherever they went. Wessel had fully expected Wendland to be just like his superior, but clearly he was mistaken. And thankfully so, otherwise this would've been a fruitless endeavour.

A large, black object was hidden in the corner of the room, draped in clothing and backed behind a chair, but anything above a passive glance could tell that it didn't belong there. Remembering how the clothes were originally placed, the agent took them off and uncovered... a safe. After relaying this information, some surprise was felt from Wessel's side, but it quickly faded away as he considered his options. There were two, each with their pros and cons.\n\nThe first was to simply bug the system. Wendland was not a very competent nor careful person in Wessel's eyes, so he highly doubted that he would spot that his safe was bugged. It would give easy access to whatever was heard inside his room, though the contents of the safe itself would not be directly uncovered to him.\n\nThe second was to blow the damn thing open and run like hell.

This was no petty crime, and as Wessel left the room, his mind began stirring. It was impossible that Gehlen let his vice president run amok so freely, taping conversations. Even for a man as bizarre as his superior, he didn't consider him to be that incompetent - and so the worry in his mind refused to go away as he and his agents abandoned the warehouse and wiped any trace of their presence clean."

He prepared orders, he scouted locations, he made sure that the points were covered and that the loopholes were closed. There was nowhere for this insubordinate to go. Nowhere to run. All the secrets that Wendland had been hiding from him would be revealed, whether he wanted to or not.\n\nAt the crack of twilight, Wessel stood tall, facing down the stoic gazes of about seven agents, all looking at him, all betraying no emotion on their face. "Today, you will spend the entire day searching for a single man in this city. We've put down a few locations, and you will each visit them together. Do not separate, do not stand out, do not hesitate. Your goal is to do only one thing, and I expect you to succeed with haste." They all gave sharp salutes in tandem with each other, Wessel nodding once.\n\n"With my authorization, Horst Wendland is now considered a wanted man in Germany and its subsidiary territories. The charges are treason, insubordination, and conspiracy against the state. Do you all understand?" He asked, and to that the men responded with a "Sir, yes, sir!""

By that night, they were laid out in front of a table, Wessel himself looking over what was stolen from Wendland. He only wished that blowing their cover - literally, in fact - would have been worth it.\n\nPapers and files, cases and documents. All things Wessel handled gently, but all things that served no purpose to him in the end. They were all about other things not related to the Büro Wessel, or Antifa, or the student protests. Frustration that was present in his mind only grew throughout the night, until after about half an hour of searching, there was nothing.\n\nExcept the one thing yet to be researched. There was an undeveloped roll of film, waiting to be explored. With only one avenue left, Wessel pursued it with intent to find out if this whole operation wasn't just a waste of time."

After all, it was only the results that mattered.\n\nAnd the results eventually came. In his office, he was handed the developed film by an agent of his who hadn't looked at it, and then promptly left the office, leaving the man by himself. From the top, he uncovered his thumb to look at the first picture of the set, and...\n\nWessel felt his heart drop. On the first picture - the very first - there was an image, clear as day, of something being pictured against a wooden table. On a closer glance, he could make out the markings and the design. This was no ordinary document. This was a document that belonged to the Büro Wessel. Then another picture - this time it was open, revealing its incredibly damaging contents inside. While his face was stoic, his mind was in a whirl. Drawn in by the shock, he looked at another image, then another, then another.\n\nBy the end, it had been a long time since Wessel felt such anger brewing in him. But it was driven with a purpose."

When he eventually spoke, Wendland nearly jumped out of his skin. "Don't waste my time, Horst." Wessel almost snarled. "I want you to answer a few simple questions for me." Wendland backed away, his face already paling. "N-no, wait, what do y-you mean by 'simple questions'?" He asked back, and Wessel merely stared at him further.\n\n"What reason did you have for taking pictures of top-secret documents belonging to the Büro Wessel?" His was a voice of stone, betraying nothing, but those familiar with it could make out the invisible intricacies. The purest sense of anger. Wendland only managed to stutter a few meaningless words before Wessel cut him off sharply. "Full sentences. Scattered words do not answer my question."\n\n"I... I c-can't tell you! If I-- if I did, I'd-I-I wouldn't-" Wessel loudly sighed. "Next question." His eyes narrowed even further. "How did you manage to take these pictures? You are--were, under the direct oversight of Reinhard Gehlen." Something was implicated in his words, and Wendland's eyes widened. "No... no, don't ask me that! Don't ask me that!" He yelled, and Wessel's posture refused to change as he spoke. "Who were your associates, Wendland? If you can't answer that, I'll have to pass you on to my other agents."\n\nHe backed up behind a wall, and kept his hands tight on the uncomfortable bed below him. Tremors ran down his limbs, and he couldn't help to stop the incessant shaking of his head, telling him to look away. "God, no, please, I can't-I don't..." He trailed off, and Wessel raised an eyebrow. Would he finally speak? He was almost about to feel some relief when Wendland suddenly shut his eyes tight and made a strange noise akin to a grunt and a gasp, as his head rolled back. When Wessel saw that, his stance broke, and he muttered the slightest 'no' before shouting an order for his agents to come over."

He had been feeding them information ever since he joined. Why?"\n\nReinhard leant over the desk and ground his cigarette into the crystal ashtray. "You seem to forget who is debriefing whom, Herr Kätzchen." Gerhard internally grimaced at the all-too forced codename. "I do not like what you imply. Felfe was a traitor, and his treachery caught up with him." He looked pointedly at Wessel. "You are not privy to the details of every operation this organisation performs. I suggest you get used to that fact."\n\n"Verflitzes Kätzchen" glowered, though his face remained a mask of patience. As he wished.

"These," he continued, pointing fingers at the pictures in front of Gehlen. They were... damaging, to say the least. Proof that Wendland had taken pictures of top secret info that only Wessel's agency would have access to. "What are these, sir? How did the vice-president of the RND get these images? Not only that, he committed suicide via a cyanide pill when questioned about it."\n\nGehlen, after a long period of silence that only served to further annoy Wessel, sighed. "Agent Verflitzes Kätzchen..." He began, pushing the pictures towards him slightly. "These questions shouldn't concern you. They should concern me." He said, voice tightening slightly. "I know the trigger for his suicide. When you asked him about who these pictures were for, correct?" At that, Wessel's breathing became just a bit heavier. "Are you looking for something, Agent... ? A sort of... conspiracy, perhaps?"\n\n"Sir." Wessel returned, staring with an attempt to scan Gehlen's emotions. They were not pleasant. "I am not making any claims. I just want to find out why Wendland took these pictures, and why he committed suicide. If I can get the help of the RND..." Gehlen shook his head. "No, no, no. Agent, you misunderstand. I never requested that such a thing like this be in your portfolio when I gave you your own agency." Gehlen's frown turned into a light smile, and Wessel felt like he wanted to grab on to something. "This is not your problem to deal with. It is mine. I suggest... downscaling your ideas of what you should do and realizing what you should not do."

The bracing wind forced him to pull his coat closer to himself, and he quickly entered the black Mercedes awaiting him. "Pleasant trip, sir?" The agent sat opposite him proffered him a file, and gave a tap on the glass between them and the driver. The car pulled away with a purr.\n\n"As good as it could be in this weather." Gerhard opened the file. He had read it before but he preferred to commit information to memory. Paper was unreliable. "Where is Felfe located. The sooner we find out what he knows about the autopsy, the better. "\n\nThe agent looked down sheepishly. "I'm afraid we've been unable to locate him, sir. As soon as I arrived I swept his known hangouts, but by all accounts he hasn't been seen in over a week. We searched his home top to bottom, but no luck."\n\nWessel gave an almost imperceptible frown. The agent's head lowered further. He had expected complications, naturally - complications were nine tenths of his work. Without Felfe, however, this lead was a dead end. Felfe was apparently only person left to have seen the autopsy report, and the fact he hadn't already revealed it indicated he was saving it for someone else.\n\nThe car slowly pulled its way through the streets of Kyiv. It was a difficult task - the roads were potholed and clogged with a mixture of ancient Soviet vehicles belching smoke and imported German cars, seeming all the more grimy for their spots of gloss black. The signposts were a confusing mixture of German and Ukrainian - both in Cyrillic and the bastardised Latin script that had developed from the confluence of cultures.

It was remarkable what you could learn just from walking the streets, visiting the bars, finding the feel of people.\n\nNaturally, the Ukrainians and Russians remained churlish against the Reich, with many a drunken curse raised against the Germans. While his agents had indeed determined the presence of local resistance movements, both left and right, they were not his concern. No, it was what he had found in an alley behind a decaying beer hall that disturbed him.\n\n"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit". Not words he had expected to hear in this place, the severed half of their national anthem. Well, one of them, he smirked. He tossed the pamphlet back to his desk, the black, red, gold seeming to glow in the light. Reichsbanner had beaten him here - a deeply disturbing prospect. He had expected locals, but for German insurgent movements to have travelled this far East?\n\nThis all but confirmed it - Felfe's previous mission regarding the Ukrainians was only a secondary concern to him. Felfe no doubt knew Reichsbanner had been here, but had never reported it. He had been compromised. A skilled infiltrator, Felfe would have attempted to worm his way into the local resistance. Gerhard knew not where to find Reichsbanner, but his Büro had leads on the Ukrainians. He would find the man, by hook or by crook."

No claim that outrageous holds up to close inspection however, and a few smashed printing presses later revealed that the author, one Viacheslav Chornovil, occupied the deep forests outside Kyiv along with his band of outlaws. Chornovil was viewed as something of a Robin Hood figure by the locals, and had been a great disturbance in the region to Wessel's colleagues. Thus the Büro began its search, finding a remarkable lack of dissidents and a surfeit of trees. It was not until one agent quite literally fell into the answer, that they located a tunnel.\n\nOne geologist and several aerial surveys later, they determined the locations of the other entrances. Thus, Gerhard waited, lying under a pile of branches and camouflage netting. Two other entrances were monitored by his two best agents, and they had made note of the incomings and outgoings of the sizeable tunnel complex - more than two dozen separate people were noted. Wessel made a mental note to order any similar networks rooted out immediately. Through his binoculars, Wessel noticed motion. Glancing at the blurry photo captured yesterday, he recognised the moustachioed face of Viacheslav Chornovil clambering from a cramped tunnel, before sitting on a rock and lighting a cigarette. Gerhard exhaled sharply as he recognised the second rising figure as Heinz Felfe.\n\nGerhard cursed himself for the distance at which he had placed himself - overly cautious, he could not hear their words. However, a shared cigarette and a firm handshake could only imply a deal was being made. He was about to shift closer, when the crack of gunfire ripped through the morning silence."

Felfe lay at the edge of the clearing, blood already caking his shirt.\n\n"We were expecting you, Wessel."\n\nDespite his best efforts, Gerhard started at the use of his name. Chornovil rose, and gestured to his men to let Wessel stand.\n\n"Felfe told us many things. He knew you would come after him eventually. You spend too much time chasing corpses, Mister Wessel." Chornovil smirked - despite Wessel's trained expression, he knew he had struck a nerve. This was undoubtedly not what Gerhard had predicted. Felfe had revealed infinitely more than he expected, and certainly not out of incompetence. "I will admit, I did not expect this attack. I presume it was not your doing, yes?"\n\nGerhard scowled. It would be smart to remain alive - and it would be smarter still to understand why he was allowed to remain alive. "Yes."\n\nChernovil stood eye to eye with Gerhard.

No decision should be made without the most complete knowledge of the situation possible, and it was the Reichsnachtdienst that kept these channels of information open - or so he had thought. It seemed Reinhard had fallen into that old spymaster's trap, the hoarding of knowledge for his own sake. It was therefore up to Wessel to restart the flow.\n\nTo the untrained eye, the headquarters of the Reich's foremost intelligence agency was just another office building. Cleaners have a unique ability to go unnoticed in a crowded room. All too easy for a loose sheet of paper or a cassette to fall into the bag while its owner was preoccupied. A microphone concealed within a lampshade might be noticed in an office, but nobody would even consider searching for one behind the bowl of a toilet, and conversations become less formal when one has their fly undone.\n\nGerhard now enjoyed the fruits of his labours in his office. The unmarked cassette was playing into a pair of headphones. The fact that this tape existed at all was damning enough, but the contents disturbed him greatly. The recording was of a phone conversation - at one end Gehlen's crackling voice; the other, the unmistakable tone of their Führer Albert Speer. He listened to it to its completion, then removed the film from the tape, concealing it within an empty bottle of pills. Gehlen was a true rogue agent, at the head of one of the world's largest intelligence agencies. Reinhard was smart, and revealed much while demanding nothing - nonetheless, Gerhard could recognise the hint of extortion.\n\nTruly, nobody was without sin - Gerhard had known many of the darker secrets of the Reich, but could only hypothesise whether Speer had been party to them. If Gehlen revealed any of what he had found, the Reich would collapse in on itself. Speer had buried his past deep yet Gehlen found it nonetheless. A stark warning of what he was facing. If he was to act against Reinhard Gehlen he must act fast - for the safety of the Reich that his mentor had so clearly forgotten."

I have a message for you."\n\nGerhard turned to see a man in dark sunglasses. The man extended his right hand with a slip of paper, clearly expecting him to take it. His left was lazily resting in his coat pocket. Wessel reached into his pocket as though reaching for a pen; his eyes darted from side to side, establishing the visitor was alone. The man's eyebrows furrowed, and the corner of his mouth turned as he realised his bluff had been called.\n\nWessel pulled his penknife from his pocket all too slowly, as the man's left hand emerged from his coat holding a slim pistol. In one smooth motion the man's arms straightened, the oversized suppressor brushing against Wessel's ear as he jerked to the side. Its detonation nonetheless deafened him and threw off his balance, and he fell into the assassin in a tangle of limbs. A blind thrust of the blade made contact and he stabbed, the knife finally connecting with the man's throat.\n\nWith a gurgle the man in sunglasses expired. Wessel arose, clutching at the side of his head. The bullet had grazed his skull, and from what he could tell taken most of his left ear with it. The shot had roused the rest of the Büro, and Wessel had to slam down the telephone of a wide eyed secretary who was in the process of calling the Orpo. Whatever number was dialled next, Wessel could guarantee it would not be the one that picked up.\n\nHe barked out swift orders to leave. His Büro had planned for a situation similar to this, though he had never thought they would ever be implemented. His staff would scatter, and the Büro would go dark. He, however, had a meeting to attend. If Speer was compromised, he had to find the next best thing.

He attempted to piece together the recent events in his head, whilst he had a moment of peace.\n\nDutschke's murder had been the flashpoint, and Gerhard was now all but certain Gehlen had ordered it. Further still, Bachmann had been eliminated to throw Wessel off the trail. Gehlen's Büro had been hoarding secrets, making hidden contacts, selling information that was not theirs to sell. They had actively been working against Wessel's own agents from the beginning. To what end? And most damning of all, Gehlen was extorting the Führer himself - one last insurance policy in case the depth of his double-dealing came to light.\n\nHow had this happened? Reinhard Gehlen was an intelligent man, one Wessel had looked up to. Now, Gehlen had sunk to sending hitmen after him in broad daylight. He was sloppy, out of touch, and most of all he could not be trusted. Trust was everything in their business - who to trust and distrust decided who was alive and who was dead. He turned to look out of the window, and glimpsed a dull red glow.\n\nHe shook off the protesting doctor, and went to the window.

Wessel was forced to agree once he had, out of curiosity, surveyed the figures. If slavery were to be abolished at once, the Reich would collapse, for few Germans had maintained the skills required to manage an industrial economy. Of course, this message went unheeded by the slaves themselves.\n\nKZ Monowitz, a work camp producing synthetic rubber for IG Farben, had suffered in productivity this last month. The predominantly Polish workers had attempted a campaign of passive protest, gathering in their hundreds and refusing to work until their demands were met. These demands had included increased rations, shorter working hours and the right to contact their families outside in what was once Poland.\n\nUnfortunately, these demands had not reached the capital by the time the protests had been dealt with. The camp guards, some of whom had been dealt a beating before being expelled had received encouragement from the camp's management in IG Farben, and with support from the local Orpo force bloodily retook the camp. Fatalities had been estimated at up to 70% of the workforce. The duty of Wessel and his Büro was to improve future camp security, and prevent the spread of protests."

The other half was occupied in attempting to maneuver the protestors - they were so much easier to deal with if they could be contained, restricted to areas less affected by their tendency to damage property, excluded from the chance to march up and down.\n\nEvery time, however, they had been rebuffed in their efforts. Attempt to cordon them in one block and they acquired a supernatural knowledge of the way out. Reports from one end of the city of spontaneous riots would turn out to be false leads, allowing further damage in other areas. Every time they attempted to contain the protests they found some way around, creating the constant background of yelling that seemed to encompass Germania these days.\n\nDamnation, but Reichsbanner was good. They moved protestors like Napoleon moved musketmen, and galvanised them just the same. He could only pray that they would remain one step behind, and not fall further."

While all were reluctant to send in the army, it had been accepted to use off duty servicemen and party members in old police gear. Still, the line seemed all too thin.\n\nHis investigations had been slow. These protests were organized - radio frequency scans had revealed encrypted transmissions of a type that none of his cryptographers had been able to break yet. That the code would be broken was inevitable, for his Büro had unofficial access to the largest supercomputers in the Reich - the question was, would that be soon enough? If Reichsbanner were responsible they were proving smart enough that more than likely they would have shifted to new frequencies and new codes by the time they RND had broken the encryption.\n\nHe allowed himself a cigarette - a rare luxury. Addiction was a weakness, but it had been long enough that he didn't care. Whoever was behind this had funding and brainpower, enough to stay that one step ahead. There were not many groups with that kind of combination, to defy the most powerful intelligence gathering organisation in the Reich. He started making a list."

Kurass's official report states that he acted in self defence when Muller attacked him with an improvised weapon. Muller's friends, when later questioned, would state that Muller was dragged into an alley by Kurass and his comrades. The post-mortem examination confirmed that Muller was shot in the back of the head. The results had not been published, and the internal investigation had soon been called off. Kurass would be remanded internally, for to bring charges against a police officer at this time would be dangerous.\n\nWessel cursed the thugs they hired to the Orpo, cursed the whole sorry affair. He did not have to view the protests from his window anymore - he could hear them. The past day had been a constant roar, such that he and most of his staff had remained at home, relying on information passed between the Büro and their own secure phone lines.

No more aliases or stupid disguises, no more double dealings or treason. Once I am done with the Reichsnachtdienst, it will be extremely hard to tell you ever existed at all."\n\nReinhard gave a sad smile. "As it should be, I suppose. Many of my decisions were mistakes, I know, though I'm sure you'll disagree which ones. But the one thing I am sure was not a mistake, was you."\n\nThis time it was Wessel's turn to be taken aback.

He'd heard of information gathering operations in Germany, and rumours of operations in the USA and Japan - today he'd been informed their networks extended across the former Triumvirate, the Reichskomissariats, China and Indonesia, virtually every theatre of conflict on the globe. RND operatives had been unable to uncover little of their operations other than their presence, and the fact that wherever Burgundian agents went, chaos and destruction soon followed. He'd heard unsubstantiated reports that they were behind virtually every political assassination in every country in the past twenty years, and partisan movements across the globe had been noted to carry arms bearing arms traced to the Silent State.\n\nThe motives for these operations were still unknown, with a single shred of concrete information from stolen SS documents in Italy sent before their mole went dark - the operations all contributed towards Himmler's Globalplan. Why? What twisted plan did the Reichsführer SS have that required murder on a global scale?\n\nWessel picked up his phone, and started making calls."

speermilitary.2.desc:0 "To the people who had been looking at the victory parade after the end of the last war, it must have seemed ludicrous to even think that the German military supremacy over the entire world could ever falter, even in a thousand years: sadly, as most things human, all it took was a couple decades. Without the threat of a powerful enemy, corruption and infighting began tearing the Wehrmacht apart in what historians would probably call "a twisted parody of the Late Roman Empire"\n\nLike the Roman generals they were so fond of, the highest German officers bought the loyalty of their men by promising hefty bonuses at the end of their service, siphoning the needed funds from the Reich's budget with the subtle threat of open revolt should anyone refuse them. As a result, the Wehrmacht bloated horrendously, eating more and more of the public expenses and contributing to the final collapse of the German economy. The increase in dimensions, however, didn't result in a better military: on the contrary, overloaded logistics, unfit recruits, outdated equipment and infighting between officers turned what was once a jewel of efficiency into a wheezing sick patient, as the Second Russian War showed perfectly.\n\nNow, with the civil war over, Von Tresckow has planned a large reform of the German armed forces to return them to their former glory. The program will concern all of the Wehrmacht, from the Heer, to the Luftwaffe, to the Kriegsmarine: everything will be turned upside down, until it fits his ideals once again. However, this won't be an easy task: many officers of the old guard are still in active service and will try to resist the reform at all costs, especially if they are supported by the conservative elements of the NSDAP. It seems this battle will be far more political than expected..."

The German air force was the personal playground of Herrman Göring, the man responsible for the current decadence of the Reich, and a large number of officers owe their rank to him: despite his defeat, his political clout is still present, and it will take time and effort to remove it before any real reform can be passed without mass desertions or worse.\n\nGöring's influence, however, wasn't limited to the officers, but it covered even the doctrinal aspects of air combat. As of now, our air fleet is heavily unbalanced towards long-range bombers - the result of a decade-long bombing campaign over Russia and Western Africa - and even worse, due to the gargantuan costs of running such a meaningless operation, there weren't enough funds to develop new airframes to keep up with the new discoveries.\n\nAs a result of this, the Luftwaffe is extremely outdated in both doctrines and equipment, despite its large numbers, and will most likely perform with abysmal results against any modern air force of the world."

The truth is that what was once the pride of the Reich is now little more than a rotting carcass, bloated by the corrupt mismanagement of the previous High Command and filled with unfit recruits who were only too grateful to be able to escape economic depression and finally eat a warm meal every day. This exponential growth, however, overloaded the supply system until it finally broke, and only served to enrich the weapons industry in cahoots with the military leadership.\n\nWith the constant downturn of the German economy, more and more money was diverted towards maintaining this living corpse - the mere thought of cutting military spending was met with subtle threats of civil war - with the result that any kind of research or improvement was halted due to lack of funds. Poorly-trained soldiers, outdated panzers, malfunctioning aircraft and old doctrines were the reasons for the collapse of the German defenses during the West Russian War, but not even this was enough to let the corrupt High Command understand the depth of their mistakes, and the Heer continued its decadence.\n\nWith the civil war over, the Heer has been left reeling from its losses and from the difficulty of serving once more alongside those who mere months before were manning a machine gun aimed at you. This, however, is also the perfect time for reform: Von Tresckow has a clear idea of what he wants the German army to become, and he won't stop until it has become reality. This, however, might be difficult, as several prominent generals and field marshalls, chief among them Ferdinand Schrörner, will try to stop him at any cost."

With the Reich focusing its doctrine on trade interdiction as the war became longer than expected, large and expensive capital ships such as the Bismarck were kept anchored, and the seas became the hunting ground for rabid packs of nimble, mass-produced U-Boots: the British and American economies were crippled, paving the way for the Axis to win in the long run, and for Admiral Dönitz to cement his position as the navy's helm.\n\nDuring the following years of relative peace, the Kriegsmarine was mostly left to rot, and most of the navy funds were slowly siphoned towards the Heer. The West Russian War saw spelled even more cuts for the navy as the generals took more and more funds for their pet projects and to feed the bloated monster that was now the army.\n\nWhen the civil war broke out, the Kriegsmarine sided with Bormann, but Dönitz decided to retreat to Crimea, realizing that no matter his allegiance, there was no way the navy could do anything except getting either sunk or scuttled.\n\nDespite surviving the war almost untouched, however, the Kriegsmarine is in a dire state. Years of neglect have left the navy small and obsolete, with most ships dating back to the last war: as things are, a total overhaul is needed in both doctrine and equipment, to bring it back from the dead and turn it into a modern fleet. Despite the resistances of admirals formerly close to Dönitz, von Tresckow knows a new and powerful Kriegsmarine is necessary if Germany is to return at the forefront of military innovation."

On one hand, we could go the safe route and focus on infantry weapons: better rifles and grenades will have an impact throughout the entire Heer, no matter the unit or doctrine. Another choice is artillery: gone are the times of giant railway guns, now self-propelled weapons and light, infantry-portable mortars are the way forward, improving mobility and efficiency of the support units. Some wish to improve the support echelons of the Heer with better logistics, modern engineers and advanced medical detachments to fully aid our troops in their task.

When the officers of the Wehrmacht started siding with this or that pretender, swearing their loyalty to their frontrunner, they caused a bloody civil war that caused untold amounts of victims.\n\nNow, some reformist officers wish to fully detach the army from the party, even more than what the new leader desires, and the first step would be to replace the oath of loyalty to the Führer with a more neutral oath to the nation and its institutions. While these officers aren't showing any sign of disloyalty, and will accept any decision on the matter, it's evident that this will have repercussions on the larger political debate: already the reformists within the Reichstag call for a comprehensive reform to remove any political influence in the army, while the conservatives are trying to stop what they call a "dangerous push towards anarchy"\n\nAs the government is called to decide on the matter, what will the Führer do?

Given the predisposition of Berlin and the unnaturally lethal tone of the message, we have been given every reason to believe that they intend to make good on their promise.\n\nOur forces - those that will follow our orders at least - are being made ready, though none hold the delusion that the Reich's warmachine could be bested. Perhaps, however, they will not have to be. Given our geographical position and relative miniscularity, it is unlikely that they would bring to bear the entire Wehrmacht against Madagaskar. As such, if they send a proportionate force it is possible to resist and make a quick invasion turn into a grueling exercise in hubris.\n\nBut even so, not even our most optimistic officers expect this assumption to prove true, as the Germans are just as likely to rain ordnance on our heads until we throw down our weapons or die in the process, and it's likely they don't much care which outcome arises first.

However, an airplane is much more complicated than a gun or a tank, and even the testing process reflects this: once the research department has finalized the proposed designs, the testing truly begins with the flight tests.\n\nIn this phase, unfortunate pilots are put at the helm of what can range from a perfectly-functional jet fighter to a flying coffin only waiting to close itself on the poor sod. Takeoff accidents, on-air engine failures, sudden airframe detachment, and many, many more: the list of the problems experienced by testing pilots is only as long as the list of the causes of their death, and many promising aviators have met their untimely end just because the one in charge of development forgot to factor a zero, or to put a comma where it was needed.\n\nStill, no one can deny that the results of this tear-filled process are extremely promising, and so the airstrips of the military airports across the Reich fill with strange, barely-flying planes challenging the laws of physics with frames barely kept together with glue, thread and the fervent prayers of their pilots."

speermilitary.21.desc:0 "Fritz Jacobsen looked outside the window, the evening sun painting the sky of Nuremberg in dozens of shades of pink. "Such a perfect time to fly," he thought with a small sigh, then he chuckled: his wife always complained that he lost entire hours staring outside the window, but what could he do? He was an aviator, his very soul linked to the endless blue: only his brothers-in-arms could understand the feeling of longing to be up there, high into the clouds, literally on top of the world. Humans however, unlike birds, need artificial wings to reach above the clouds, and he was too old for that now, so he did the only thing he could do: he looked outside, and remembered the old days.\n\nHis gaze passed over the small display case near the fireplace: his two Iron Crosses were there, alongside his pistol and a small piece of the airplane he almost died inside when he was downed the second time. He shuddered at the memory, but even those difficult days were so beautiful, so dangerous, so exciting! Back then, when he had served the Kaiser in Italy and France, airplanes were but wooden caskets with an engine: to think that such things could even fly without exploding! And yet he was witness to their agility and power, and to the bravery and camaraderie of the men piloting them. He remembered the Caproni bomber he desperately tried to take down above Treviso, only for himself to be the one falling to the ground. He remembered flying over Verdun during a night with no moon, the artillery strikes lighting the darkness like a starry sky upside down. He remembered his comrades, his friends, even his enemies, all people who fought with their life to the line, and never surrendered.\n\nA voice awakened Fritz from his small trip into the past, and he realized the sun has long since set. Poor Margarethe, she cooked for him and even had to call him! With a last look to the sky, he got up from his chair, and from the creaks in his bones he could have sworn it was an airplane taking off: his legs were starting to fail him like an old engine. He turned his back to the window and left, but he knew a part of him was still there, staring at the sky."

speermilitary.22.t:0 "Fresh Blood"
speermilitary.22.desc:0 "For the entire Wehrmacht, but the Heer more than all others, the Bürgerkrieg was like a scythe wielded by death itself, decimating simple soldiers and officers alike as the fighting degenerated in house-to-house combat, where the entirety of Germany was the frontline, and the command tent was a place like any other to fight and die. The following period wasn't any kinder to the Oberkommando der Heer, as many disloyal, corrupt or incapable officers were systematically purged, leaving a large hole in the officer corps.\n\nHowever, from problems come opportunities, and Von Tresckow knew this very well. The Prussian general spent the years of the reconstruction not only reforming the army doctrines and structural organization, but also training the new generation of officers, to ensure they wouldn't follow in their predecessors' footsteps. One of his greatest achievements was the establishment of the Offizierschule des Heeres in Dresden: staffed by the best remaining military theorists, the new institution was made so that cadets from the entire Reich could learn the new doctrines of war in a suitable environment. Of course, said "environment" would be filled with references to the Prussian discipline and the reformist ideas...\n\nDespite the ideological issues, however, no one can deny that the Offizierschule has done an excellent work. The end of the first training cycle, and the subsequent ceremony in which the young cadets took their rank as full-fledged officers of the Heer, marks a new beginning for the armed forces of the Reich: we can only pray that these new generals and lieutenants will prove worthier than their predecessors, and able to keep the Wehrmacht from descending once more into decadence."

speermilitary.23.desc:0 "Karl Dönitz felt a bit of deja-vu as he entered the Führer's personal office. He had been there many times, but this time, the man seated behind the desk was different. Albert Speer looked at him sternly, Henning Von Tresckow standing at his side, his back rigid and a slightly offended expression on his face. The admiral advanced to the desk and stopped, saluting the Führer as protocol demanded even though his demeanor made it clear he would have wanted someone else on that chair.\n\n"Admiral Dönitz" Speer began, his voice severe, "I have called you here for an important matter regarding your conduct during the civil war"\n\nThe old admiral knew it was coming, so he steeled himself for what was to come. "I'm ready to take my punishment if it is needed," he answered with a calm, resigned voice.\n\n"During the civil war, it has been proved beyond doubt that you took Bormann's side. Not only that, but you also fled the country during the chaos, taking the majority of the Kriegsmarine with you, disobeying all orders to fight and finding refuge in Crimea"\n\n"I did that to save the Kriegsmarine!" was the immediate answer, but what came next surprised him.\n\n"I know that, admiral, and through your action, you saved many ships which would have been lost, or even worse, used against us. For this reason, Von Tresckow and I came to an agreed and fitting solution."\n\nA barely audible snort told the admiral that the "agreement" was mostly on one side, but he focused his attention back on Speer.\n\n"For Betraying the Reich and fleeing, you will be stripped of your rank as admiral, and formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty. For saving the majority of the Kriegsmarine from certain destruction or capture, you shall be graced, and your decorations will not be revoked."\n\nThe now-former admiral felt a pang in his heart knowing that his service was over in such a way, but he knew it could have been much worse. He took off his hat and deposited it on the desk, then saluted and left the room without a word."

Chief among them was the traitorous admiral Karl Dönitz, who had fled from Germany with the majority of the Kriegsmarine to find refuge in Crimea. After the end of the war, the admiral surrendered himself when threatened with retaliation from the new government in Germania. His hopes of keeping his rank were shattered a few months later, when he was formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty, and tried together with several SS members and generals who followed either Göring or Bormann.\n\nWhen the day of the verdict came, Dönitz stood with the other defendants in the courtroom. The judges entered the room, one by one, and then read the final sentence: the admiral didn't listen what had been decided for the others, though the amount of screams and cries told him that convictions were far more than acquittals. Finally, it was his turn, and it took all he had not to join the rest of the accused in their screams: "The court declares Karl Dönitz, chief admiral of the Kriegsmarine, culprit of treason and dereliction of duty, and for this he is sentenced to be stripped of all his ranks and decorations, and to thirty years of detention"\n\nAs the guards stripped him of the signs of his rank, he didn't protest, and when they brought him away in handcuffs, he didn't even try to resist. He simply followed, his head low, shame radiating from him like the stench of treason he emanated."

A suitable location - a hill surrounded by a small forest near the coast - had been labelled "enemy fortification" and suitably equipped with bunkers, tents and mock emplacements containing old machine guns and artillery pieces. At the given signal, the combined might of the Wehrmacht was unleashed upon the unfortunate earth mound.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine opened fire upon the enemy positions, neutralizing anti-air batteries and grievously damaging several other emplacements. Immediately after, bombers from the Luftwaffe dropped their deadly cargo upon the trenches, anti-tank cannons and machine guns, clearing the way for the Heer. Tanks rolled towards their target, and infantry both motorized and on foot followed in their wake to occupy the objective. Thanks to the radio coordination, there were no instances of friendly fire, and the entire operation was declared a success.\n\nFor the entire time, Henning Von Tresckow looked with a satisfied expression at the scene unfolding a few hundred meters from his command tent. Several other members of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht - generals, aviators and even a couple Kriegsmarine officers - were present, all murmuring their approval for how the army reforms were having their desired effect. The Prussian general allowed himself a smug smirk: everything was going as planned."

SPEERUSA.1.t:0 "The Meeting"
SPEERUSA.1.desc:0 "It was rare that official letters were passed between their governments, usually restricted to under the table negotiations when they communicated at all. This situation called for an open hand however - and a letter penned by an articulate one.\n\nThe Führer lowered the paper and set his gaze on its author who stood before his desk. Reichsminister Helmut Schmidt had shown eagerness at the prospect of reaching out to the Americans. The letter was good - stately but not too domineering, eloquent but not flowery. The letter was not the question. The Americans may have sent arms back when he was directing mobs of students, but now he was at the helm of the ship, who knew what they would want? "I'm sure I don't need to impress upon you the importance of this summit. You represent "\n\n"I do. The Americans want things to cool down just as much as we do. They'll have their demands, but I don't think they'll be unreasonable with our country's history of walking out of negotiations." Schmidt gave a bitter smile.\n\n"Give them what they want, I suppose." Speer glared at the telephone as if anticipating it's angry ring later. "Just be reasonable."\n\n"

The Americans had actually afforded Germany an opportunity to reach out, and he would damn well take it with open arms.\n\nAs he sat down with the American ambassador, he could notice that he was an older man who seemed to radiate an aura of joyfulness around him. Not a bad pick. Hopefully cooperative.\n\n"Greetings-" His English was sharp, lightly-accented. "- Ambassador. Walter C. Dowling, was it? I'm Helmut Schmidt." He gave the man a hand. "Pleased to meet you." Who then shook it heartily.\n\n"A pleasure, Schmidt!" A noticeable Georgian accent, but it passed by Schmidt's foreign ears. "I'm happy that the Reich's finally reaching out." He gave a short chuckle. "Getting concerned that things would get hot."\n\nSchmidt shook his head. "Not at all, Mister Dowling. The new regime is quite open to change. Now... this won't be easy."\n\nThe tension faded into reality. Both of them knew where this conversation had to lead. Dowling gave a short nod. "Yes... I hope you've come prepared. The negotiations that the United States has in mind will not be easy to compromise on. Agreeing to this would be a historically unprecedented move, especially considering the Reich's past."

"Excellent work, Helmut." The other members of cabinet gave the Foreign Minister a polite round of applause. Stifled coughs interrupted the backslapping, an unavoidable consequence of Schmidt's ashtray filled with cigarettes, along with Erhard's seemingly endless cigar. Speer waved his hand at a secretary who scrambled to open a window.\n\n"Where do you intend to hold this meeting?"\n\n"I imagine there'll be some back and forth about that. Somewhere neutral would be preferred, if such a place even exists these days. Iceland perhaps, though if we push we could get them to visit Hamburg. It didn't come out of the war too badly"\n\nAlbert suppressed the urge to mention the obvious fact that it was also Schmidt's home.

Not a bad view, and certainly a welcome change from Berlin's - Germania's, he mentally corrected himself - progressively more ugly skyline.\n\nThis place might not have been the Führer's first choice for their summit, but Schmidt had managed to persuade him of the sense of the location without saying too much of the true reason. Speer would have wanted them brought straight to Germania to see his Volkshalle - the Führer thought himself a humble man but how he could stand to see that bulging growth of national arrogance every day, Helmut could not understand. The Americans would not like it, as much as they loved their monuments. Plus, it was fucking freezing in there.\n\nThe door opened behind him. The Reichsminister turned and gave a nod before the messenger could speak - the Americans had arrived. Helmut ground his cigarette into the ashtray that rested on the windowsill. It certainly was an amazing view. The lights of the old city, uncorrupted by the colossal yet crumbling architecture that seemed to define their Reich's recent history.

We have refused the Americans' other two major demands, but even this relatively smaller undertaking is causing a humongous uproar among the military high command. It'd be nice if the idiots in the OKH were able to realize that engaging in diplomacy such as this de-necessitates the use of their fancy nuclear toys in the first place, but regardless this move is what's best for Germany so we will not heed their inane screeching."

SPEERUSA.20.t:0 "Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.20.desc:0 "While the most dedicated Nazis and hardcore social conservatives are likely to fearmonger about the potential slippery slope it causes, we have agreed to give the millions of slaves across the Reich a degree of human rights. To those in our administration who oppose slavery for economic reasons, moral reasons, or both, this concession is actually a major relief; because it is a move for the purpose of lifting the trade embargo between ourselves and the United States, those who would disapprove of our decision will be convinced it is purely for pragmatic purposes.\n\nConsidering America's own tumultuous recent history with slavery, we hope that this considerable change in policy will be enough to persuade them that we are worthwhile and ethical partners. Whether or not that is the truth is irrelevant as long as the Americans see us in that light, of course."
SPEERUSA.20.a:0 "Surely Germany will now be a paragon of morality."

SPEERUSA.21.t:0 "America First"
SPEERUSA.21.desc:0 "Let's be realistic. Outside of the Reich, who does Germany even have strong relations with these days? No one in the Sphere, the OFN, or Russia. South America? Not really. If we want to form strong economic ties with one of the world's foremost economies, it is hardly much of a sacrifice to guarantee the Americans first dibs on the bounty of products and services the Reich has to offer. This move will certainly make a restoration of trade much more enticing to the Americans, as it will undoubtedly be a huge boon for their economy and development. As it would be for ours as well.\n\nHopefully, this economic offer is enough to satisfy them, as we are effectively refusing their other two (political and ethical) offers. It's not like the US is a perfectly moral actor themselves, so who are they to judge anyway?"
SPEERUSA.21.a:0 "They probably care more about their imports than our slaves."

SPEERUSA.22.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and America First"
SPEERUSA.22.desc:0 "We have decided to give in to two of the three major American demands: we will somewhat reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile, and will grant the United States unmitigated priority trade access to the many goods produced in the Reich. While we have denied the request to grant our substantial slave population a greater degree of rights, these other two concessions will hopefully not be as potentially harmful to our social fabric and popularity. Of course, we are still experiencing a large amount of hostility from our military and from our few diplomats to non-OFN countries.\n\nmHowever, these sacrifices will ultimately be worth the heavy price, as the economic and geopolitical opportunities which would open up to the Reich if the Americans agree would be monumental. Therefore, we are simply awaiting the American response to our most gracious compromise."
SPEERUSA.22.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.23.t:0 "Slave Rights and America First"
SPEERUSA.23.desc:0 "In what is correctly being considered to be a very large concession, we have decided to agree to the American demands to grant limited rights to the millions of slaves working in the Reich, and to give the Americans priority trade access to all of our goods. Due to other geopolitical considerations, we have refused their third demand to reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile. Still, there is likely to be major opposition from the most ideological members of the party and the Reich at large, though we don't have much of a choice.\n\nWe chose to make these concessions because the benefits are predicted to outweigh the social costs; we must engage in more trade if we ever want our economy to recover! Let us hope that these policies are enough to persuade the Americans to engage with us, as we would be rather hard pressed to concede anything more. This is for the good of the Reich, and so it must be enough."
SPEERUSA.23.a:0 "A necessary trade-off."

SPEERUSA.24.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.24.desc:0 "In order to appease the Americans, we have agreed to both reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile and grant limited rights to the millions of slaves existing within our borders. While we do expect major backlash from both the military and social conservatives respectively, we are fortunate enough that, in the long term, neither of these changes should cause serious harm to the Reich's social fabric or economy (provided we handle them with the utmost care).\n\nBecause of the significant economic gains we would be poised to make in the event the Americans do agree to open up trade with us, such a generous display of good faith will likely outweigh the costs. Additionally, many worrying reports regarding the extent of subversive political groups throughout the Reich suggest that there might even be a subset of our population which is strongly in favour of these reforms. Though that is hardly any consolation, since it is the resistance of people in powerful positions we have to worry about."
SPEERUSA.24.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.25.t:0 "We Have Agreed to All Demands."
SPEERUSA.25.desc:0 "We have accepted all of the American demands, to reduce our nuclear stockpile, to allow American companies first trade rights in our country, and yes, even allowing more rights for the slaves.\n\nIt's not an ideal situation, but nothing is in this world.

Speer has been working tirelessly to ensure their fears, and to show them that these concessions to the Americans were necessary for the Reich to not only heal, but to grow from what it was before. He has given speeches from Germania to Frankfurt, praising the Reich's diplomats, and the Americans for understanding the need for friendship. Soon, he says, all Germans will have their lives improved with the end of the american embargo.""

SPEERUSA.29.t:0 "The City That Never Sleeps"
SPEERUSA.29.desc:0 "Upon arriving in New York City, Schmidt didn't know how to feel. He'd never seen a city like this before. It was cluttered with countless tall, imposing, and- frankly- ugly buildings that left a unique and indescribable impression which could be felt nowhere else on Earth. What was it? This city was so foreboding and yet so utterly charming. Why couldn't a single German city produce this sort of emotion in its architecture? It made Schmidt want to explore!\n\nUnfortunately, reality got in the way of Schmidt's daydreaming. An entourage of diplomatic staff awaited him, and Schmidt was stuck shaking their hands and exchanging pleasantries for what seemed like an eternity. But, Schmidt reminded himself, restarting relations with the United States was of the utmost importance and would lead to the betterment of living conditions for all of humanity. So of course, Schmidt buttered up every last staffer as much as he could without brown nosing, and even managed to engage in some legitimately friendly and amicable conversations. Hell, he even managed to crack a few well-received jokes. But once all of that babble was said and done came the sightseeing.\n\nNaturally, there was beautiful Central Park, flashy Times Square, the monumental Empire State Building, and of course, Lady Liberty herself (admittedly not as large as expected from a distance but still symbolically powerful). Interestingly, Schmidt at one point passed through a neighbourhood called Greenwich Village, apparently home to people and activities his colleagues considered "degenerate," though Schmidt never understood how people's private business bothered others. All in all, Schmidt had rarely had a more exciting day and was completely enthralled by NYC's alluring atmosphere."
SPEERUSA.29.a:0 "New York, New York: A hell of a town!"

SPEERUSA.30.t:0 "The City of Angels"
SPEERUSA.30.desc:0 "As the Luftwaffe VIP plane began its descent, Schmidt couldn't help experiencing a mixed range of feelings upon viewing Los Angeles's skyline. While it was no doubt impressive, it seemed as if it were a work of progress that had stalled and stunted over a decade ago. The abundance of military installations and vehicles surrounding the city's harbour reminded Schmidt that the Japanese occupation of the US's major West Coast Ports had likely crippled the region's industry and thus the growth of what was once the most impressive city on the entire Pacific Ocean. Of course, it wasn't like the Reich was in much better shape after its own self-imposed economic downturn and the Bürgerkrieg. "More lives being ruined by fascism. What's new?" Schmidt thought to himself. But voicing such opinions aloud would be just as damaging to his mission here as it would be to his career (and no doubt his life) back home.\n\nMuch more concerning than the quality of L.A.'s skyline was the quality of Schmidt's reception, consisting of some random, nameless bureaucrats whose names Schmidt begrudgingly decided he would eventually learn anyway for the sake of making a good impression. After enough obligatory handshakes and small talk to drive even the most shallow of aristocrats to madness, Schmidt was finally able to do some sightseeing. There was the lively Santa Monica Pier with an ocean view unrivalled anywhere in the continental Reich, the both elegant and exciting Griffith Observatory, from which Schmidt could see the famous Hollywood sign in need of repair, and the excessive Venice Canals (funnily, now the only Venice Canals thanks to Atlantropa, yet another Nazi failure) and all sorts of other wonderful, if slightly tacky, attractions.\n\nThe bounty of interesting sights was partially marred by Schmidt's necessary security detail, but what really bothered Schmidt was the lack of opportunity to gain a real and honest understanding of how the American people lived day to day. How else could he truly understand what sort of provisions the Americans would surely want in the re-establishment of relations? And, unlike his colleagues, perhaps Schmidt actually gave a damn about the lives of non-Aryan human beings. Oh well."
SPEERUSA.30.a:0 "No time to worry about that now. Off we go!"

SPEERUSA.31.t:0 "Schmidt in the White House"
SPEERUSA.31.desc:0 "It was just a brief and simple event, and largely for the sake of the press anyways, but that didn't mean it wasn't overwhelmingly important. Yet, as he entered the stately White House grounds, Schmidt couldn't carry himself solemnly. He deserved to be jovial in front of the US president and the press. This signing was his success, and more importantly, a success for the downtrodden citizens of the Reich and the United States. Why shouldn't he appear to be happy on the outside, since that was exactly how he felt on the inside?\n\nCracking a gentle smile, Schmidt shook hands with the president amidst the flashing of the journalists' cameras, and together they walked along the North Lawn and up the steps beneath the building's facade. The president approached a podium standing on the porch and gave a rather run-of-the-mill speech regarding the value and necessity of the deal which was about to be officially signed. Then it was Schmidt's turn.\n\n"Don't worry, I'll keep this very short. We are here today because we have finally realized that we should stop shooting ourselves in the foot, and that it is better for us to cooperate. I assure all of you that some of our previous administration's, so to speak, policies which some might have found a little unsavoury are in many instances unlikely to continue in the same fashion as they have for the last several years. I believe that this is a period of drastic change, and just as today is unrecognizable to the world of 25 years ago, the world 25 years from now will be unrecognizable to us today. And so, we absolutely must ensure that our future is one of prosperity and cooperation, and of a higher quality of life for all of our citizens. This treaty is an excellent first step. Thank you very much.""

Though the détente has panned out headspinningly quickly, we of course arranged for Mr. Schmidt to meet with the president for dinner at the White House.\n\nMinister Schmidt was incredibly polite and even jovial, and had little trouble easing any perceived tension between his and our envoys. Apparently a joke of his even cracked a laugh out of the president, which if true would do much to alleviate the pervasive stereotype that all Germans are humourless.\n\nSchmidt and the president stood before the White House's North Lawn and all of the press to officially sign the document ending the embargo between Germany and the US. May God bless the United States of America, and may God bless our new... partners... the German Reich."

SPEERUSA.33.desc:0 ""Mr Dowling, a pleasure. I hope you find our country to your liking." Schmidt shook his hand like it owed him money, and Walter blinked at the bright sunlight that was assaulting him but a moment after he had left the safety of the plane.\n\n"Herr Schmidt, good to finally meet you" he replied, attempting to assert himself. The United States is eager for our parties to come to an agreement for our mutual benefit."\n\nSchmidt smirked behind his face. Off guard and backfooted was how they needed them - diplomats could be so predictable when they fell back on their instructions. Of course he wouldn't have organised this meeting without having planned every moment himself. The issue was too important to be delegated. He gestured to the vast Mercedes-Benz that waited to shepherd them away, shining a glossy black from windows to tyres.\n\n"Of course, of course, but first you must see the sights. Hamburg is a truly beautiful place.""
SPEERUSA.33.a:0 "Hamburg's canals are one of the loveliest sights in Germany."
SPEERUSA.33.b:0 "The city's gardens are unparalleled in natural beauty."

SPEERUSA.34.t:0 "The Canals"
SPEERUSA.34.desc:0 ""In fact, Hamburg has more bridges than any other city in the world!" Schmidt had seemed laid back at their first meeting, but now that they toured his home town the man had lit up. He gestured grandly at yet another stately bridge arcing across the canal. Walter Dowling was the first ambassador to Germany since 1941 - in fact he was the first American to legally set foot on Reich soil in more than twenty years. They walked together, their staff about thirty feet behind. No doubt they were conducting their own diplomacy behind the scenes, while Schmidt and Dowling did their best to ignore the cameras strategically posed above them.\n\n"It sure is a fine place." Walter admitted. It may not have the great skyscrapers of New York, but the place had its own, subtler history. The great city hall overlooking the Alster, the towering cathedral spire, these charming canals - he knew he was being wooed, but damn if Schmidt didn't know how to do it.\n\nThey turned a corner, slowing to allow the lackeys to catch up. Schmidt reached into his pocket and pulled out one of those seemingly ever-present cigarettes. He offered one to Walter who shook his head - half the charm of the open city was its clean air, and he already had a splitting headache from the morning spent locked up in that smokehouse of an office with the Reichsminister. Walter turned to examine the brickwork, and came to face something he never thought he would see. He did his best to conceal his strangled gasp as a cough, only half succeeding - Schmidt turned to view the line of bullet holes in the wall, the discarded rubbish that littered it's base, and the bare earth turned to mud that formed a long stain stretching into the canal . The hangers-on rounded the corner as well, and Helmut took a long, long drag. Just when he thought he'd located the perfect route."
SPEERUSA.34.a:0 "There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this..."
SPEERUSA.34.b:0 "This is not what it looks like.."

SPEERUSA.35.t:0 "The Gardens"
SPEERUSA.35.desc:0 "One of the most touching moments of the visit was when the delegation visited the restored Tropengewächshäuser, Hamburg's botanical garden. A painstaking effort had been made to bring them to their former beauty: old photos had been retrieved, and from them a team of experts had acquired the original plants and flowers from their exotic homes, and rebuilt the pavilions and paths scattered across what was once a place of peace and tranquility. Just like that garden - that was the message Reichsminister Schmidt was trying to convey - the entire Reich would slowly become a better place for everyone.\n\nEven though the plants were still very young, and the grass still had to cover all the new flowerbeds, the American delegation was impressed by the effort. That is, until a diplomat stumbled upon a small earth mound while exploring a more secluded part of the garden, dislodging a few stones and revealing what was buried right below.\n\nAt first, Helmut Schmidt was annoyed by the commotion, but as soon as he turned away from his conversation with the ambassador, any trace of mirth disappeared from his face along with its color: barely hidden under a thin layer of earth and stones, was a human arm, its decomposed flesh barely covered by a tattered uniform, dried blood stains still visible on the discolored fabric. The workers were called, and they soon started digging: the first corpse was carefully set on the side of the hole, but immediately under it, another appeared, and another, and another. Despite all the prayers running through Schmidt's mind, they didn't stop.\n\nAs the sun started setting, one hundred and fifty-eight bodies clad in military uniform had been unearthed, and now the entire American delegation was turned towards the pale, heavily-sweating ghost of what was once Helmut Schmidt. The ambassador looked at him sternly, and his words felt steel-cold to the Minister, like an executioner's blade on his victim's neck: "Explain this, Mr. Schmidt. Now." and the answer he received was..."

SPEERUSA.36.t:0 "A Heated Conversation"
SPEERUSA.36.desc:0 "The American delegation found that they were in for a treat. Speer had himself personally been delivered in the Großer Mercedes to the Hamburg City Hall. Upstanding German citizens had transformed the Emperor's Hall into a magnificent dining room, and the tables were set for a great roast dinner, with plenty of drink on the sides. The Krauts and Americans began with a great conversation on cultural comparisons and personal anecdotes, but stalled for a good half an hour as the head of the delegation and the Führer himself engaged in a fierce argument over the differences between capitalism and national socialism. After some time, the foreign minister, Helmut Schmidt, stood up and managed to reconcile the opposing interlocutors.\n\nEven if Herr Speer and the delegation may not see eye-to-eye, Schmidt showed that there is some democratic and liberal spirit thriving underneath the Reich. The reports back home to Washington that night were ample in praise for the regime in Germania. Truly, the Reich is a land of wise men, great artists, and certainly delicious meals."

He stood and held it up to Schmidt's eyes. A high heeled shoe, stained a muddy red. For the first time in a long time Schmidt stumbled on his words - his mouth curled in an ugly expression before he sighed and flicked his cigarette into the canal.\n\n"There was much collateral damage. While the students may have been some of our Führer's most ardent supporters, they were... overzealous.\n\nDowling scowled and dropped the shoe. How many innocent people lay at the bottom of that canal?"

Then, the militias launched a pincer manoeuver near the university, along the Grinderallee, forcing the enemy to retreat under heavy fire: while most managed to leave, a group of around two hundreds SS took refuge in the botanical garden, but in the end they all either died fighting, or committed suicide.\n\n"I beg you, try to imagine how this beautiful city was after the attack" the Reichsminister pleaded as his audience listened, "Ten thousand civilians had been murdered, the hospitals were full of wounded, the university had been turned into an emergency infirmary, and the obituaries were exploding with bodies so much that we had to store them in the market square: hundreds of innocents and loved ones piled like sandbags, waiting for their turn to be buried without a funeral!" Finally, he looked at the lined corpses with tear-filled eyes, and no one could truly understand whether they were the practiced trick of an expert diplomat, or if one of those "sandbags" after the battle had been someone he knew. "We couldn't bury them. There was no place in the cemeteries, not even for our own people. Sad as it may be, they were buried here not out of cruelty, but to avoid the spread of infection."\n\nAfter a minute of silence, the American ambassador hugged the Minister, expressing his sympathy for the population of this wounded land, and asked him if he was still able to continue the negotiations. Visibly relieved, Schmidt nodded, and they left this small piece of a horrible past behind."

Dowling is subtly suggesting the Reich as it is now would never be able to stand the test of time, and though Helmut agrees in his heart, he can't help but think his duty was to defend the Führer's work: Speer may be an asshole sometimes, and block his reforms with stale concepts such as "moderation" and "not risking another civil war" but openly criticizing him? He wouldn't be so undiplomatic do such a thing in front of a foreign delegation!\n\nAs he takes the wine in his hand, he knows he has to make a choice: counter Dowling's subtle accusations, or divert the course of the conversation?"

The head of the delegation and the Führer himself spent a good half an hour discussing the merits and faults of capitalism and national socialism, a spectacle thoroughly enjoyed by all present, and all in good faith.\n\nAs the inebriated Americans clambered into Taxis back to the hotel, they had nothing but thanks to give to their hosts. The reports back home to Washington that night were glowing in praise for the regime in Germania. Truly, the Reich is a land of wise men, great artists, and certainly delicious meals."

SPEERUSA.51.t:0 "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"
SPEERUSA.51.desc:0 "The murmuring Americans hinted to Schmidt that expectations were not particularly high. They assumed the festival would consist largely of cringeworthy propaganda informing them of Aryan racial supremacy and the glory of the Reich's many military conquests. Luckily, Schmidt had foreseen that issue, and had twisted the arms of the Propaganda Ministry to ensure that only a selection of the Reich's many entertainment and artistic films were chosen for the Americans' viewing. Convincing Speer that impressing the Americans with enjoyable films was more pragmatic than angering them with propaganda was not very difficult.\n\nAnd indeed, the reactions Schmidt distinguished indicated that Das deutsche Filmfestival in Hollywood was at least a mild success. By far the most popular work shown was an ambitious remake of the hit 1942 drama Die große Liebe; its message was subtly shifted from one of commitment to war to being anti-war, but what really caused it to stand out was its new star: renowned comedy actor Heinz Rühmann, demonstrating his versatile acting abilities portraying Paul, the romantic lead. Schmidt overheard plenty of positive comments and perhaps, even, a few sniffles?\n\nIt was hard to say if a few flicks would really help restore a positive relationship between the US and the Reich, but it certainly didn't seem to hurt!"

SPEERUSA.52.t:0 "Fear and Loathing in Reno"
SPEERUSA.52.desc:0 ""Americans love watching things go fast," explained Schmidt. "If you say so," replied Speer. And that settled it, a Luftwaffe squadron would participate in the Reno, Nevada Airshow. At least they'd be able to get some "practice" that didn't involve mercilessly terror bombing innocent African and Russian civilians. But Schmidt did not care to attend the airshow, as he didn't wish to be reminded of his time at the Ministry of Aviation; after all, didn't he effectively have a hand in those terror bombings? No, he wouldn't think about it. The sooner Schmidt's diplomatic endeavours succeeded, the sooner Germany could be rid of Nazism, which was all that mattered now as far as he was concerned.\n\nFrom what Schmidt had heard from one of his envoys, the airshow had been another mild success, with the Luftwaffe squadron impressing the Americans with a variety of formations, maneuvers, and one particularly sharp turn that apparently caused a great number of gasps. Well, as long as all of these goodwill gestures were appreciated by the Americans, Schmidt had nothing to worry about. A few more tours, a few more fun events, and everything would turn out fine... hopefully."

SPEERUSA.53.desc:0 "As the relationships between the Reich and the United States of America improve, trade trickles, then flows, and finally flourishes between the two former rivals. The crowning of Reichsminister Schmidt's efforts finally comes in an official communique from the American ambassador in Germania: with a great fair being planned in Boston, not only has the Reich been invited, but an entire pavilion has been reserved for its exclusive use!\n\nImmediately, the news is broadcasted nationwide, and an inter-ministerial committee is immediately appointed to oversee the preparations: with the complexity of such an affair, it's only natural that the ministries for the economic, diplomatic and internal affairs work together to ensure the fair turns into a success. The Führer's open blessing to this endeavor underlines once more how much sway does the Gang of Four hold over the German government...\n\nAt the committee's first meeting, after a first opening message by Albert Speer, in which he encourages its members to "amaze the world with the Reich's greatness", everyone starts working in earnest. As soon as the first folders are opened, already an important question arises, one which will influence all future works: what kind of event will the fair be?\n\nSome wish to create a reduced version of World Fair on the model of the great 1937 Paris fair, where the German pavilion towered over all others; members from the ministry of research propose a technological fair, where the greatest progresses of our scientists and inventors can be put on display for the world to look in envy; finally, more than a few voice their support for a very peculiar idea, which is a cultural fair: rather than showing industrial or technological progresses, how about showing the world that which makes our country unique? As no one wants to back from their position, the committee's head is forced to call a vote, and the final decision is..."

SPEERUSA.54.t:0 "World Fair it is"
SPEERUSA.54.desc:0 "With the decision taken, the committee can now work head-on towards a World Fair, where all the progresses of the German nation as a whole can be put on display for the world to see and drown in its own envy: each country of the Pakt will have a place to put their culture and their national industry on display. Architects and artists from the Reich's most prestigious faculties and circles are called to design the pavillon, and the tycoons are already in line to have their work showcased.\n\nAs the first lines are drawn, however, a sore point immediately stands out: we are going to have an exposition in a country we fought, and defeated, a mere twenty years ago, and there are many who would strongly oppose all our government stands for; should we try to create a "neutral ground" for the fair, removing all symbols of our regime - especially the swastikas - or should we show the world what we truly are?\n\nOf course, the conservatives are outraged that such a thing is even being discussed: we are a National Socialist nation, and Hitler's guidance was what brought us from a defeated nation, to the world's greatest empire! Denying our legacy is a crime against those who lost their lives to make the Vaterland great!\n\nOn the contrary, reformist members, especially those aligned with Schmidt and Erhard, fear that the sight of a banner with the swastika might scare off American investors, and draw heavy criticism from the political establishment, compromising the fair's success: as such, they vocally ask to "tune down" on the symbols of what may be our political ideology, but risks hurting the feelings of our hosts.\n\nAs the discussion doesn't seem to end, the chairman sighs and calls for a vote on the issue: "those who are in favor of removing all political symbols, please raise their right hand!" and the result is..."

Delegates from the most prestigious universities, technical faculties and research institutes buth public and private flow in and out of the committee's offices, trying to get their work displayed. At the same time, the architects are already hard at work on the pavilion: it will be modern and functional with its straight lines and visible steel frame, but beautiful and full of light as the glass walls bathe everything in a complex game of lights and mirrors, giving the fair an out-of-the-world feeling.\n\nWhile everything goes smoothly, some of the committee members start to notice a worrying trend, as a large part of the exposition is being reserved for military inventions. As they point out to their colleagues, we are being hosted by a nation we fought with those exact weapons a mere twenty years ago: surely, their veteran associations and the conservative political establishment would strongly disapprove, or even boycott the fair!\n\nWhile some agree with this train of thought, others stand up, and reply that our new discoveries in the military field are extremely important, and will surely amaze the world! We won the world not thanks to poorly-armed conscripts, but with technological excellency and constant improvement!\n\nAs the discussion keeps going on, the committee head calls a vote to settle the matter once and for all: after the hands are counted, the fair will..."

The committee is already preparing the events which will take place in the various sections of the pavilion, from a small Oktoberfest directly from Bavaria, to traditional dances from Tyrol, Alsatian wines and Prussian cuisine: we shall show the world that we aren't what we were before, and that now there's space for happiness even in our war-torn country!\n\nA lighter atmosphere pervades the committee as reformists and conservatives can't find any truly divisive matters. The building itself fills with color as a variegated crowd enters the offices to vie for patronage: woodcarvers with their finest creations, patissiers bribing the members with an enticing offering of pastries and receipts passed from generation to generation, and even a choir in their traditional attire singing outside the office! The committee headquarters shine as it becomes, just for a few days, a melting pot of German culture.\n\nAs time passes, however, an issue arises. This time, however, the line of division isn't drawn between reformists and conservatives, but between "alcoholics" and "sanctimonious prudes" as they have started calling each other: as hundreds of beer distilleries have offered to sponsor the event, and many of them have asked to have their stands and stalls all throughout the exhibition, there is the question about whether to officially endorse the beer companies or keep the fair family-friendly.\n\nThe committee chairman calls for a vote on the matter, not before finishing his beer though..."

As the pavilions are dismounted, and everyone starts the long journey to their respective homelands, it's time to draw a final balance of the event: numbers are truthful, and the results have been... awesome!\n\nAlmost two hundred thousand people visited the German pavilion, and the various expositions inside were appreciated by everyone. The Amerikaner felt welcomed by the elaborately-decorated building, especially since, with the sole exception of the official flag of the Reich present here and there - the only point the Führer was adamant about - it was devoid of any national socialist symbol. The worries of the Gang of Four proved correct: without anything to criticize, the hawks within the American government were silenced, and everyone enjoyed the fair without any kind of polemic.\n\nWith the resounding success of the event spreading like a wildfire throughout the Vaterland, the reformists acquire even more power within the government, something which irks the Führer more than a bit. In the end, however, he knows this will benefit the Reich, and he'll be the one to ultimately reap the fruits of their efforts, so for the moment he has decided to keep his grumblings to himself, and influence the work of the Four with a lighter tough, as any true ruler knows how to do."

This moment was not to be taken lightly.\n\nSmall talk was made until the food arrived: the main entrée was a succulent, mouthwatering roasted goose, and Schmidt simply couldn't help himself. "I suppose you could say the goose is cooked?" (Schmidt's English was very good but he hadn't yet gotten a full grasp of this particular idiom). Surprisingly, it got a genuine chuckle from the president, perhaps because he simply appreciated Schmidt's attempt. But from then on, it was if the air had cleared, and friendly, amicable conversation proceeded as if the two had known each other forever.\n\nLater, on a very full stomach, Schmidt and the president went out before the sea of reporters and staffers to sign the document officially ending the embargo between the US and Germany. "If we can't kill each other, we might as well trade, no?" cracked Schmidt, getting plenty of laughs despite the unfortunate degree of truth buried in the joke."

SPEERUSA.59.desc:0 ""Indeed, this wine is truly good! Is it Alsatian?" A slight shadow passes over Walter's face, as he has been deprived of a nice political debate, but he understands why Schmidt chose to divert the conversation: he knows where Helmut's heart truly lies, everyone knows it, but rubbing the faults of the government he's part of in his face would be too much. So, he accepts another glass of wine from the server, and they discuss the pros and cons of Alsatian and Bavarian wines compared to the omnipresent Italian ones, especially now that the entirety of Northern France no longer produces anything worth of note.\n\nThe evening soon turns into night, as the two parties socialize more and more, passing from topic to topic with a spontaneity that is almost unbefitting of seasoned diplomats, but with enough wine, everyone becomes a good friend! As the last desserts are finished, and the waiters begin clearing out the table from the used cutlery, everyone gets up, and all shake their hands before the Americans return to their diplomatic quarters.\n\nA second before boarding the car, Walter Dowling looks seriously at Schmidt: "I know what you are trying to do for your country, Helmut" he begins, opting for once to let go of diplomatic platitudes: "The United States are still unsure about how to truly consider your Führer, whether a true reformer or simply an astute liar, but as long as you are part of his government, I am willing to believe that this country can truly find a way to prosperity after what it has suffered. Good luck with that" and then he is gone, leaving a surprised Schmidt behind."

In truth, that this would happen was already an open secret: ever since the first news of what the Reich would bring to the fair were leaked to the American people, a wave of unanimous protest arose from all political parties, from the moderates to the hawks, against what the newspapers called 'a show that hurts the eyes'\n\nThe days following the grand opening weren't that much eventful, and indeed some visitors from the Reich and other aligned nations were well-welcomed by the personnel, but most of the American public remained far away from the pavilion. When the fair closed, the balance was judged 'sorely negative' and the reformists, like the legendary Cassandra, could only look sadly at the numbers with an expression that said 'I told you'\n\nPerhaps, the conservatives should choose to fight worthier battles..."

As the American public visits our stands, they meet and talk with our people, and learn that we aren't swastika-bearing, Hitler-worshipping, slave-driving monsters like some propaganda depicted us trying to prevent us from being invited to the fair. The more the Americans accept us as we are now, the faster we can improve our standing and recover from the destruction wrought by the Bürgerkrieg."

Our exhibitions and shows have amazed the Amerikaner, and they have visited our stands in numbers we couldn't even imagine.\n\nAs the pavilion is dismounted, and everyone starts their long journey home, the Führer has expressed his congratulations to the "heroes of the Reich abroad" who managed to "show the entire world how much we have changed" after all the sufferings we endured. Our diplomatic standing with the United States has also considerably improved, and Reichsminister Erhard already predicts a surge in foreign trade with members of the OFN!"

SPEERUSA.67.desc:0 ""Adolf Hitler was, shall I say, not the most popular figure outside of the Greater Reich, mein Führer." \n "Your point being, Herr Schmidt?" asked Speer. \n "Well, mein Führer, I was thinking it might be a prudent move for our administration to... distance ourselves from him. It'd be wise to demonstrate that we are no longer seeking the brutal conquest which was, of course, a cornerstone of Führer Hitler's foreign policy, you see." \n An awkward pause lapsed as Speer considered Schmidt's borderline treasonous suggestion. He chewed on the idea for several moments before nodding to himself and saying, "I can see how doing so would be beneficial to our diplomatic efforts, and it might even improve my personal image abroad. But of course, there will be strong resistance from many people here in Germany, especially the social conservatives. I trust you will help our administration deal with any backlash?" \n"Oh, why of course... mein Führer," replied Schmidt, who seemed to assume a noticeably brighter demeanor."

The sound of angry protestors and even a few "Heil Hitlers" could be heard not far from the Reichstag, which certainly helped to illustrate Speer's skepticism. \n "...Yes. Distancing ourselves from him is absolutely necessary, mein Führer," replied a distant and distracted Schmidt. "I need to go for a walk." Schmidt gave a timid but respectful salute to Speer and quickly exited the building. \n As he walked down Adolf-Hitler-Straße and past the Adolf-Hitler-Platz, Schmidt noticed the many lingering signs of war: former soldiers aimlessly walking the street, some with broken or missing limbs and some begging for spare change; a fair deal of unemployed non-veterans, too; and there were even some buildings that had leftover damage from accidental shelling or bombing during the Bürgerkreig in which so many had sacrificed so much simply for that cunning bastard Speer to enact a slightly less brutal and genocidal version of his predecessor's ideology. \n Adolf Hitler was a man who brought so much unnecessary suffering and destruction to the world. How could the German masses revere him so? Schmidt figured he'd have to emphasize the world's fear and hatred of the man and avoid non-starters like his absurd racial beliefs and genocide. It was a ridiculous and unfair situation, but like always Schmidt would just carry on and make the best of it."

Suddenly, a call interrupted his rancorous thoughts: he answered, listened, and not five minutes later his men too were in parade at the sides of the road. The commanding SS looked at the ten watchmen, slightly amused: "Is this everything the mighty Reich can summon against the Righteous?" he spat at his counterpart. Then, the earth began to tremble.\n\nBefore the SS could speak again, a Panzer appeared from behind a building, and moved at full speed towards the border. The black-uniformed soldiers remained still as the tank got closer, closer, CLOSER. When only a few meters separated the armored beast from the soft flesh, Rudolf smiled in glee: the men in black took one step backwards, then two, and then everyone was falling in disorder as the Grenzwacht laughed.\n\nWith a loud noise, the tank halted one meter over the border. The SS returned, indignation etched over his face: "You are trespassing on the Ordensstaat! I demand that-" he stopped when faced with the barrel of Rudolf's pistol. "You hold no authority here, Verräter" he spat, feeling cruel joy in the way the other's face contorted. "This land belongs to the Vaterland, and you are unlawfully occupying it. There are no borders within the Reich, and the traitor you call "master" will soon understand it!"\n\nAs he spoke, several trucks unloaded a hundred Heer soldiers, who immediately set up building fortifications. The watchman looked the SS dead in the eye, and his voice was cold as steel: "It's only a matter of time before we return to Paris. Enjoy your black uniform while you can, for one day you'll hang from a balcony, and I'll be the one to push you DOWN" and for the first time, Rudolf saw fear in the eyes of the SS."

The black-uniformed German took the letter and gave it a cursory read: he already knew its content, as it was identical to the speech given by the Führer just the day before, then he put it into his pocket and returned to his position, without any outward sign of either interest or worry. After all, it was nothing but the formal certification of the current state of affairs\n\n"Citizens of the Reich, today is a sad day for our country. As Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler has refused to cede command and face due trial for his actions during the war which tore our country asunder, he is immediately relieved of any office and is to be arrested on sight for treason and mass murder.

The two officers saluted in unison with a simultaneous, "Heil!"\n\nSpeer returned the gesture and stared at the map with a furrowed brow. "Let's hear your proposal, Generalfeldmarschall." He trusted the man little, and his military strategies less, but Speer knew better than to deny an audience with a man so influential in the militarist movement.\n\n"My proposal is simple," Schörner boasted, almost dismissively. He waved his hand generally across the land below him. "Warfare is fought in the mind as well as the battlefield. It's one thing to throw empty words at the Jews in the White House; it's quite another to strike true fear into their craven hearts." The hawk jabbed his finger close to the East Coast, and for a fleeting moment Speer thought he was about to argue for a declaration of war against the United States. "We should fly our strategic bombers straight towards internationally recognized American airspace, before turning away at the last moment! True fear will grip the Americans, and their leaders will be on paranoid alert, never knowing when a first strike is truly coming. I call it 'Schwarze Walküre'."\n\n"Herr Speer, this is far too risky!" Von Trescow shook his head in disbelief. Schörner glared at him with the shards of ice lurking behind his spectacles."What if our pilots fail to turn away in time? What if the Americans act prematurely?"\n\n"These mongrels slighted the Reich!" Schörner snapped, his spittle spraying across the map. "They're not stupid enough to retaliate, but it will teach them a lesson they won't forget."\n\nSpeer silently rubbed his chin in thought.

At least another dozen pings were picked on the onboard radar up further behind them. Likely, no, definitely above.100% out of sight, but not out of mind.\n\n"Command, I have visual on five escorts, picking up at least another dozen on my radar, over." A pause. A second, than another.

"No running in the hallway!" he announced sternly to the forty or so elementary children. It took more willpower than he cared to admit to not crack a smile as his students let out the barrage of humble sorrys and yes Herrs.\n\nThe day was warm and sunny; it was a beautiful day to play ball. The teacher watched from the sideline, occasionally passing back a ball kicked out of bounds. Johann felt at ease here at school. Although scars maimed his face,, anyone who knew Johann could vouch for his giant heart. Johann was always calm, and tried his hardest to be fair and kind, to great success. Though they wouldn't admit it to his face, his students only sang praise about their teacher to his co-workers and their parents, to Johann's embarrassment. Still, it was welcome praise; the children gave him purpose. Although he had lost his pregnant wife in the civil war, being a mentor to the next generation of Germans gave Johann hope. Here he was, helping to raise a new generation, and he did so with much kindness. In a way, they were his family. He did however envy the children; not having to join a Nazi chapter to have friends or to particapate in the football clubs. They didn't have to know party politics to be able to swim at the local pool, nor they weren't judged by their devotion (or lack of) to Hitler's cult of personality. They could be children. It was a wonderful time to be young, and he was glad that he fought for that.\n\nThe sound of jets roaring overhead nearly made Johann flinch, his reflexes almost taking control over his body, even after all these years. He took a deep breath. He had to stay composed for the children.\n\nJohann looked above, watching yet another airwing soar above his head, heading northwest, likely following the last hundred or so plans that came before that week. Another batch of strategic bombers. Worrying.\n\nAs the children cheered and waved at the soaring planes above, the seed of worry in his head grew more. Why was there so much traffic in the air? Why were they all moving northwest? He pondered as the planes flew out of sight. A ball hit his leg.\n\n"Herr Steiner, can you pass the ball?" A little girl yelled from across the field. He passed the ball, now absent minded, his smile and good mood gone."

The man hung up the phone. "God damn Germans..." Smith muttered.\n\nNo more than a minute passed before the President stormed into the Situation Room with their Secret Service attachment stalking close behind.\n\n"Who has my briefing?" The President barked. Shit. The currently overworked staff simply had no time to compile a folder. "Over here, sir!" Smith called as he rushed frantically from his desk to the map in the middle of the room. The President quickly stalked over to the large table, where tokens representing airplanes stood placed in the North Sea, red marker scrawls noting the planes' previous locations and their intended route; Iceland. Smith paced around the table, clearly nervous. "Sorry sir, we didn't have time to..." The President waved him off. "Forget the paperwork. What's the situation?" "Well sir..."\n\n"Five German strategic bombers, nuclear capable, are en-route to our bases in Iceland. NORAD has been tracking them for twenty minutes; they figured it was a long distance training mission. However, they haven't stopped their approach, and are heading right for our airspace. We've already scrambled an interceptor wing." A pause. "How many German planes total?" the President asked. "Is it a probe? A full scale invasion? Something else?" The Preisdents voice rose. "What the hell is this?" Another tense second passed. "We don't know, sir." Smith replied flatly. "There looks to be twenty-five planes total, including the five bombers. NORAD has no idea what their intent is, but they are REALLY stressing that those planes are nuclear capable. Most of that staff want us to hit them now to prevent a potential bombing. Most of the guys here..." Smith motioned to the ten or so men feverishly plotting routes and making phone calls. "...including myself believe that the Germans are making a show of strength and have no intent on crossing our airspace. We don't think they're trying to start a war. Still, our response is up to you, Mr. President, and I need your decision, now. An operator in Iceland is waiting for an answer."\n\nThe President wordless walked to the nearest desk and dialed a number. The line immediately picked up. "Smith! The fucking Germans are ten minutes out! I need a goddamn answer, now!" Over the line, yelling and the sound of chaos rang in the background. "This is the President..." The line went silent. As if on cue, the background chatter died as if the call was on speaker. The Situation Room mirrored the silence. The President glaced around the room.

Eighteen of the twenty escorts, shot down. No pilots recovered, and no word from the Americans if they rescued any. I don't know what would be better; writing the letters to the families of brave men killed in defense of the Reich, or having to talk to the Americans about returning our men they captured. This is a disaster." The Führer sighed. "What the hell are we going to do?"\n\nSchörner pulled a folder that he had tucked away, and handed it to Speer. The Führer wordlessly opened the folder and read the proposal. A moment of silence passed.\n\n"Wow. The gall of you, Schörner." Schörner finally spoke. "This was an act of war. The militarists are up in arms and demand decisive action. There is no other..." "Are you fucking mad, man?" Speer snapped. Dropping his voice, "This would start a fucking war! Are you willing to give up everything for postering, for you and the military's ego?"\n\nSchörne glanced at his feet, then looked up. "If we don't respond... we look terribly weak on the foreign stage, and God knows what happens at home if we do NOTHING. That's why we chose Iceland. Small population, but important enough to show the world not to underestimate us. Ever.\n\nSpeer's head dropped. "My Führer, it's a hard choice, but with your word, we can strike back tonight.

The room cheered; all approaching bombers had been splashed. This was followed shortly by, "Enemy fighters engaging, returning fire." The room sat in silence as the dogfight commenced over a thousand miles from the White House. Smith's stomach sank as a young man screamed "I'm hit, I'm hit!" before breaking up. Another American pilot, although calm, reported the same. He at least managed to confirm "Bailing out." before losing radio contact. The American fighters were quick to respond, twelve American interceptors who had been observing near their operational height limit dove down unto the approaching German formation, quickly scattering them, decisively changing the balance of power.\n\nAfter only half an hour, the crisis was over. The Germans just couldn't regain the initiative, and after a dozen confirmed kills, the rest of the formation scattered back to Germany. Both American fighters who had been shot down were promptly recovered, along with several Germans. The mood back in the White House wasn't enthusiastic, however.

Walter Dowling looks at the same time incensed by the rebuttal, but intrigued by the way the question had been put. "Surely democracy is better than all other forms of government!" is his immediate reply, "Men were born to be free, Helmut, and democracy is the only way such natural instinct can be satisfied: under a tyranny, there will always be resistance, and its eventual collapse is a matter of time"\n\nSchmidt understands that by talking in absolutes, this would lead nowhere, so he smiles courteously to his guest, and answers: "And yet the Reich is the result of democracy's failure, Walter. The democratic government of Weimar wasn't able to answer to the demands of the German people, and so it was replaced by a government which could meet such demands of order and rebirth. The results of this are well-known, and I believe I don't need to reminisce the events of the past two decades with you, my friend" he says, putting a bit of accent on the word "friend"\n\nDowling understands that going down this road may as well lead to the visit's failure, and also he has been taken aback by the German's point of view, so he decides to end the debate and directs an equally courteous smile towards Schmidt: "Indeed, our world is far more complex than what we would want to, isn't it?

A minute passed, then two. After three, cautious optimism started to spread. Was Schörner right after all? Would the Americans blink first? Another minute. The tension could be cut with a knife. Five. Six. After seven, a faceless administrator cracked a half-hearted joke. Eight, nine. Finally, ten minutes. The ten longest minutes in human history passed with a collective, optimistic sigh of relief. An impromptu toast was raised to Führer Speer.\n\nSieg Hail!" went the cry! And the men drank. To the bold, to the Reich, and to their fearless leader, who had redeemed their honor and avenged their recent dead; those pilots who did not return from their sortie to Iceland. Speer himself even partook, with a thin smile dancing on his lips. The Reich avenged her sons, her honor restored. Another victory for the Fatherland, perhaps her greatest yet! Who would dare to face her?\n\nA senior officer rushed into the merry conference room, breathless and white as a ghost. "They're launching! They're launching everything!"\n\nOf course,the staff, the petty bureaucrats and the oh-so-tough warmongerers fled to the bunker complexes. The sirens sounded, but it would be for naught. Speer knew that the missiles would strike with their deadly payloads within fifteen minutes. It was hardly any time for the citizens to reach the few bunkers scattered across Germany. Ten minutes after the alarms sounded, intermittent shaking began. Speer felt little terror within himself, but pangs of remorse racked his mind. As the ground heaved beneath his feet, he had one duty he needed to yet fulfil. He owed it to his people.\n\nThe Führer found Schörner standing besides a grand window facing north. Speer joined him. Neither man spoke as they watched the horizon glow, the grand beacons of light and ash approaching closer and closer to Germania.\n\n"So, this is it." The general finally broke their silence. Yet Speer could not speak. In another twenty minutes, he knew the Reich, HIS Reich, his home, would be ash. There wasn't even time for enough people to make it to the bunkers to fill them. The streets were eerily empty, and other than the cry of the sirens and the sporidic booms of approaching doom, the heart of Germany was deathly silent.

The ground suddenly jerked; another blast rocked the earth, so violently that the glass in front of the men cracked and buckled. Neither man flinched. Schörner was the first to turn and walk, presumably to the safety of the bunkers.\n\n"This is what you wanted, right?"

As he continued to stroll down the familiar corridor, four younger men; all secretaries or scrubs scurried out of Speer's office. Schörner took a deep breath, and paused outside of the door. A loud bang closely followed by the sound of breaking glass came from the other side of the door. A curse, then silence. Schörner knocked.\n\nWhat the hell do you idiots want?!" Speer screamed. He was pissed. Schörner took another breath, then strolled in confidently.\n\nThe office was a mess. It was clear that Albert Speer was in a rage; something Schörner had never seen from the usually calm and collected man. Files and papers were strewn everywhere. A full sized mirror in the corner of the room was shattered into a million pieces, specks of blood strewn nearby. Pacing back and forth behind his desk was a disheveled Albert Speer, blood trickling down from his cut knuckles. He looked up and paused; his facing darkening when he realized just who had entered.\n\n"You." Speer spoke, then paused. Schörner, for once, had nothing to say. "Make your report, and make it quick."\n\n"My Führer," he began. For once, he spoke those words without any trace of comptemet. For once, the two were in complete agreement with what had to be done. There was no backing down now. "The U-Boats are off the coast of Iceland, as ordered. They are standing by on your..."\n\nSpeer cut him off. "Did I not give you simple, easy, God damn instructions?" His tone was quieter now, but menacing. It was as if venom came from his lips.\n\n"Ah, uh, yes, sir." Schörner replied without stumbling over too many of his words. Describing Speer as 'frustrated' was definitely an understatement.\n\n"The caption refused the codes from me. Said procedure required him to hear the orders from your mouth." Speer merely stared at the general. Schörner, for his part, remained calm. He walked forwards with his typical confidence and handed Speer a note with a number on it. "The direct line, sir." Speer immediately punched the numbers into his land line.\n\n"Captain Von Steiner, reporting." The voice on the other end spoke calmly, as if rehearsed a thousand times."

The planes launched from Germany, came within a thousand meters of their airspace, then abruptly turned back, with no complications. In fact, there were even no mechanical issues. Everything went perfectly, in every sense of the word. "What is the response from the Americans?"\n\n"Officially, none, my Führer. Unofficially?

Maybe to show strength. But from men like Charles Lindburg, these incursions were a pain in the ass. Because every week, the Germans did the same thing; five strategic bombers with twenty or so escorts flew towards an OFN base or airspace, and every time they did this, NORAD had to respond as if the Germans were about to strike. Planes had to be mobilized on next to no notice, bases had to be mobilized, and the Armed Forces freaked out. Every. God. Damn. Time.\n\nLindburg was sick of it. His colleges were sick of it. The Navy man on the phone was pissed off and sick of it. But, everyone understood that, knowing the Germans, the one time NORAD doesn't react to a threat seriously would be the one time the Germans struck an OFN base. Life is fickle like that.\n\nThe man in the phone continued to yell. "Twenty five! Twenty five bogies heading towards MY airspace! I want thirty, no, fifty interceptors circling above my HQ in ten minutes!" A loud BANG emitted from the phone. Lindburg winced and rubbed his ear as he put the cold plastic back on its base. What a prick. Lindburg didn't even rise from his desk; they were already scrambling nearly two dozen interceptors; no other fighters were close enough to respond within twenty minutes.

Would he time the erratic movements of the plane just right? The plane spun right side up. He pulled the lever. Nothing.\n\nThe plane tilted about ninety degrees before the canopy popped off and the seat ejected. A sideways ejection. SHIT. The man almost cried as he looked down at the fast approaching water.

Ten minutes after the alarms sounded, intermittent shaking began. Speer felt little terror within himself, but pangs of remorse racked his mind. As the ground heaved beneath his feet, he had one duty he needed to yet fulfil. He owed it to his people.\n\nThe Führer found Schörner standing besides a grand window facing north. Speer joined him. Neither man spoke as they watched the horizon glow, the grand beacons of light and ash approaching closer and closer to Germania.\n\n"So, this is it." The general finally broke their silence. Yet Speer could not speak. In another twenty minutes, he knew the Reich, HIS Reich, his home, would be ash. There wasn't even time for enough people to make it to the bunkers to fill them. The streets were eerily empty, and other than the cry of the sirens and the sporidic booms of approaching doom, the heart of Germany was deathly silent. The city awaited her final judgement..\n\n"This is it. This is how it ends," he spoke again. A moment of silence passed. The ground suddenly jerked; another blast rocked the earth, so violently that the glass in front of the men cracked and buckled. Neither man flinched. Schörner was the first to turn and walk, presumably to the safety of the bunkers.\n\n"This is what you wanted, right?" Schörner stopped, and turned back to face his leader, who had tears welling in his eyes. "Well, how did we do, General? Did we play the part well?" he spat."
SPEERUSA.99.a:0 "They will applaud us as we exit."

SPEERUSA.100.t:0 "End this Fool's Errand"
SPEERUSA.100.desc:0 "MOST SECRET, Senior Commanders only\n\nDirective No.1 for the Reich's Military's response to the Iceland Disaster\n\n1. Military readiness will be increased for the Luftwaffe in case of retaliation by America.\n\nOur nuclear readiness will be increased in the case of needing to launch on demand.\n\n2. To be perfectly clear, there will be NO FIRST NUCLEAR STRIKE BY GERMANY.\n\nIt has come to my attention that a large part of the general staff are encouraging, or even DEMANDING, a strike. This is unacceptable, and any discontent at this critical time will be dealt with immediately and decisivly.\n\nOur reports tell us that while America is likewise increasing their military readiness, they are NOT willing to strike first with nuclear arms. Regardless, we will be prepared for any aggression on their part.\n\n3. Our PSYOPS operation has been a failure, and is to be discontinued immediately in order to prevent more loss of planes and lives, and to lower tensions between America and Germany.\n\n4. ANY AND ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS AT THE MOMENT CAN ONLY BE APPROVED BY MY SIGNATURE.\n\nIt is particularly important that any infringement of the neutrality of other states by our enemies or our own troops be immediately reported to the Führer.\n\nAlbert Speer."
SPEERUSA.100.a:0 "The end of this madness!"

SPEERUSA.101.t:0 "The Icelandic Strike"
SPEERUSA.101.desc:0 "The Situation Room was in chaos. It was full of men running around, shouting into phones or furiously writing. In the center of the room, a group of men paced around the map of Western Europe, still red from the marking that charted the German air wing the airforce decimated.\n\nThe President burst into the room, still sweaty from his run from the other side of the White House. Normally, people would stop and give them their respects. Today, the President was like any other person; not immediately important to their work, so not important enough to greet. The President scanned the room, and saw a familiar face pointing and writing in a notebook. What was his name... Smith?\n\n"What's the word on the ground?" the President asked as he approached the three men. Two of them scattered, running back to their desks while Smith feverishly lined out potential strike areas in Iceland. "You know as much as me, sir." Smith replied, still working. "Two minutes ago, a German submarine off the coast of Iceland rose to about a hundred meters and launched twelve ballistic missiles at Iceland." He finished tracing lines on the map. "Really? Speer would be so brazen?" Smith shrugged.\n\n"SMITH, SMITH, GET OVER HERE!" a nameless man yelled close by. Smith rushed over. The man punched a button on his phone, and the line went on speaker.\n\n"They're nuclear! I repeat, the missiles are nuclear! Reykjavik has been hit! We have no...." The President zoned out. Wordlessly, he found an empty stool around the war map and sat. After a minute, Smith walked back to the table, and wrote an X on all of the major harbors, cities, and most of the U.S bases and garrisons. Twelve red Xs scarred the map as nuclear fire likewise scarred Iceland. The Situation Room was dead quiet. Finally, Smith spoke.\n\n"Have we tried to raise the airforce in Iceland?" One man wordlessly rose his hand, then shook his head. "Nothing sir."\n\nThree minutes passed before an aerial reconansion confirmed their worst fears; the United States had been struck with nuclear arms.\n\n"Sir." Smith approached the President, who had yet to speak since the strike. "What...what do we do?" Quiet. Silence. Finally, a sigh. "I thought Speer was a reformer. Now look where we're at. Christ. God." The President paused. "We...we have to assume the worst. We have to act like the Germans are mobilizing the rest of their arsenal. God help us..."
SPEERUSA.101.a:0 "...we have to launch."

SPEERUSA.119.t:0 "Ban Nazi Imagery"
SPEERUSA.119.desc:0 "The news that the committee will remove all imagery tied to national socialism from the fair to be held in Boston was met with outrage in the conservative wing of the NSDAP. While the Gang of Four is pleased by this development, as they know it will greatly help the fair's success, their opponents in the government accuse them openly of "betraying Hitler's legacy" and "selling our country for a few dollars" with several high-ranking party officials and bureaucrats signing an official request to the Führer to step in and "stop this madness"\n\nAs letter of protest pile on his desk at the Reichskanzlei, Albert Speer can't help but understand the plight of the protesters. The Gang of Four clearly stands for something different that what he believes in, for something different from national socialism, and this fact sometimes infuriates him: if he could solve all of Germany's problem by removing those four bastards, he would have done that ages ago! Sadly, it isn't so simple: each of them is the best of the best in what they do, and even he has to admit they all love the Vaterland in their own, flawed way, and want to see it reborn, if under a different form.\n\nSighing, he takes another letter and reads it. He would like to simply throw them into the dustbin, but doing so would only enrage his own party even more. As he takes up the pen to answer the missive, he writes the same words for the umpteenth time: "Sehr geehrter Sekretär, though I understand your displeasure, and to some extent I even share it, the greatness of the Vaterland requires small sacrifices such as these to ensure we retake our legitimate place among the world powers. I will make sure that the honour of the Reich is upheld even in distant Amerika, and that no one dares to think the everlasting sun of National Socialism is setting on our empire! Yours truly, the Führer."
SPEERUSA.119.a:0 "Another one done, now on to the next... mein Gott, they are so many!"

SPEERUSA.103.t:0 "We Are Not Ashamed"
SPEERUSA.103.desc:0 "With the decision taken, the committee now resumes work, and the cadre of architects, sculptors and various artists tasked with designing the German pavilion can truly show how much they love their country! Paul von Esleben, a well-known architect and war veteran, has submitted the preliminary project for the pavilion, which was so well-liked by the Führer that he ordered for it to be immediately displayed on all official media as "the finest example of the Neue Moderne Nationalsozialistische Architektur" which, coming from Hitler's personal architect, goes much further than a mere political praise.\n\nThe building itself is a tall, cylindrical structure of steel and glass, representing the new Reich, tall and powerful, and yet transparent and modern, with four spyrals regularly intertwining symbolizing the conflict between the various souls of national socialism. At each junction, an eagle's head juts out, holding a flag with the Swastika to remember the battles fought between the contenders of the Bürgerkrieg.\n\nOf the four spirals, three interrupt roughly five meters before the top, where the last one turns from the usual color of steel to pure gold, just as Führer Speer managed to prevail over the flawed ideologies of his rivals and show how National Socialism was meant to be. Finally, the spiral reaches the top, where it flattens into a platform sustaining a golden swastika upon which stands perched Fritz Koenig's masterpiece, a massive eagle with its wings spread looking over Boston as a predator looks upon its prey.\n\nAs the entire Reich rejoices for such a display of national pride, we are sure to march towards a resounding success in Boston!"
SPEERUSA.103.a:0 "In art as well as on the field of battle, we show our might and our superiority."

SPEERUSA.104.t:0 "The German Future"
SPEERUSA.104.desc:0 "With the focus of the fair finally chosen, the committee can finally start working. Contacts are made with all possible companies, no matter the object of their research, and the most impressive or promising ones are immediately packed and sent to Boston. Electronics and mechanics, civilian and military, the German future will be put on display for the world to drown in their own envy!\n\nNew computers from Siemens will prove their superior calculation speed, cars and trucks from Volkswagen will be an example of futuristic lines and powerful engines, and the latest tanks and fighter planes from Porsche and Heinkel will show the Amerikaner why choosing war over diplomacy would be a very poor choice!\n\nOf course, the more awe-inspiring prototypes have been 'leaked' to the German public, rousing patriotic support for the exhibition: we must capitalize on our renewed grandeur as much as possible, after all..."
SPEERUSA.104.a:0 "It will be a success, I'm sure of it!"

SPEERUSA.105.t:0 "A Show of Commercial Science"
SPEERUSA.105.desc:0 "Despite the complaints from our military firms, and the conservative officials supported by them, in the end the committee has chosen to concentrate on civilian and commercial technological advancements. We can't risk scaring our potential customers, not so soon after having managed to finally secure a trade treaty with the United States!\n\nAlready our largest companies are stepping forward to propose their latest designs, and several smaller research institutes and academies will have their own stands to show off advanced prototypes. With our industrial and commercial might in full display, we'll prove to the world that we don't need weapons to be among the greatest powers on Earth!"
SPEERUSA.105.a:0 "We pave the way to the future!"

SPEERUSA.106.t:0 "Lots of German Beer"
SPEERUSA.106.desc:0 "In the end, the committee has chosen not to ban breweries from entering the fair, on the ground that beer is one of the oldest and proudest traditions of our already great country. The fact that the most ardent supporters of this thesis can often be seen toasting to anything coming to their mind in the most esteemed Brauhaus Georgbræu, surely has nothing to do with their opinion on the matter...\n\nAlready dozens of breweries, both ancient and new, are flooding - literally - the committee with their precious merchandise, hoping to get a stand in the fair building, and a "sampling under-committee" hurriedly forms to discern whether they are actually good beers or dirty water. As predicted, the volunteers are simply too many, and no one wants to cede their place, which prompts the chairman to select the members by extraction: of course, he "needs to be part of it" in order to "keep everything under control"
SPEERUSA.106.a:0 "A toast to the Reich! Another! Aaand... anoscher...hic!"

SPEERUSA.107.t:0 "A Family Fair"
SPEERUSA.107.desc:0 "Finally, the committee has decided to avoid conflicts with Amerikaner parent associations, and prevent any large concentration of alcoholic beverages at the fair. Even though beer is an important part of our Germanic heritage and culture, we can't let such an opportunity go to waste due to angry mothers complaining because their children want to taste that bubbling drink papa drinks himself to a stupor with every god-forsaken night.\n\nWe still have so much to show off! Toymakers and patissiers will give the children the kind of temptation no parent would ever deny, and we'll transfer an entire village from Tyrol, with the people clad in traditional garbs, with their own cuisine, even sheeps and cows: the families will absolutely love it!"
SPEERUSA.107.a:0 "Come to uncle Speer, little boy: many gifts await you at the fair.."

WORLD.2030.t:0 "Schwarze Walküre"
WORLD.2030.desc:0 "With the recent breakdown in diplomacy between America and Germany, Albert Speer, the Führer, has begun to mobilize the Luftwaffe. Anonymous sources within his bureaucracy state that Germany has approved a new operation. Codenamed "Schwarze Walküre", or "Black Valkyrie," this operation appears to be a German attempt to probe American and OFN airspace with massed air wings, including nuclear capable strategic bombers. German intentions are not clear at this time, but this appears to be a direct result of collapsed diplomatic overtures between the United States and German Reich. Foreign observers warn that already high tensions may raise even more, and caution that limited conflict could result.\n\nIt is unknown what the end results will be, but the world holds its breath as America and Germany square off."
WORLD.2030.a:0 "Who will blink first?"

 SPEERUSA.109.t:0 "The City of Angels"
 SPEERUSA.109.desc:0 "Helmut Schmidt, the new foreign minister of Germany, has decided to embark on a goodwill tour of the United States in hopes of restoring diplomatic and trade relations between our two countries. One of the first destinations on his trip is Los Angeles, California. Upon his arrival, he seemed to be somewhat bothered by something, especially when passing by the military checkpoints barring entrance to the Japanese-controlled port area. Mr. Schmidt did seem mildly interested in the various landmarks he saw such as the Griffith Observatory and Venice Canals, but at the end of the day did appear to be somewhat disappointed. Whether Schmidt's reaction was our fault or not is difficult to say, but surely he will enjoy the many other destinations he is scheduled to visit over the coming weeks."
 SPEERUSA.109.a:0 "He still has much more to see."

 SPEERUSA.110.t:0 "The City that Never Sleeps"
 SPEERUSA.110.desc:0 "Germany's new foreign minister, Helmut Schmidt, has arrived in New York City today as a major stop on his goodwill tour of the US. Luckily, in NYC, it isn't very difficult to show a man a good time, and he was taken to all of the classic destinations across the city; Central Park, Times Square, the Empire State, the Statue of Liberty, you name it. Schmidt was particularly excited and enthralled by the unique and "rough around the edges" character of New York, and seemed to thoroughly enjoy his day here. Hopefully the rest of his tour will be as thrilling as the Big Apple, but they call it The City that Never Sleeps for a reason!"
 SPEERUSA.110.a:0 "Come back soon!"

SPEERUSA.111.t:0 "The Unity Fair"
SPEERUSA.111.desc:0 "One of several events arranged by the Germans in the US as a goodwill gesture, the Unity Fair in Boston has been an unexpected success. Akin to the World Fairs that seem to happen few and far between these days, the Unity Fair has contained impressive displays of German architecture, science, technology, and culture in a manner that may have come off as slightly boastful or intimidating to some of the fair's attendees. But nagging in the minds of all who attended was the fact that restoring ordinary relations with the Germans could grant the United States unmitigated priority access to all of this incredible economic and human capital.\n\nAnd so, our people's reception to the Unity Fair was actually quite positive, with many of our citizens being rather impressed by what the Reich's best had to offer. Boston's mayor gave a brief speech thanking Germany for creating such a fun and exciting event, and at that point it seemed as if the Germans' ambitious diplomatic mission was not so out of reach as initially thought."
SPEERUSA.111.a:0 "Feel free to do this again sometime." 

SPEERUSA.112.t:0 "The Lincoln Memorial"
SPEERUSA.112.desc:0 "The final stop of his goodwill tour, German Foreign Minister Schmidt has arrived in Washington, D.C. From what we have heard from staffers present with the German delegation, the uncontested highlight of the visit for Mr. Schmidt was his stop at the (admittedly very lovely) Lincoln Memorial.\n\nDespite the supposedly much more impressive works and exhibits of Germania, Schmidt was apparently mesmerized by the statue and stood silently in its presence for several minutes. According to one staffer who was known to embellish his stories, a single teardrop could even be seen in Mr. Schmidt's eye. Either way, he seemed to very much appreciate the memorial and the great American values it stands for."
SPEERUSA.112.a:0 "The Nazi foreign minister admires Lincoln? Probably a good sign."

SPEERUSA.113.t:0 "Schmidt Sees the East Coast"
SPEERUSA.113.desc:0 "Foreign Minister Schmidt and his diplomatic entourage have arrived on the East Coast and have begun a sweeping tour across many of our coastal states. From hunting in the vast woods of northern Maine, to visiting the native-created Etowah Mounds in Georgia, to touring towns, factories, and other landmarks all over the Eastern Seaboard, the Germans have hopefully garnered a much better understanding of American culture and livelihood. We have at the very least given the foreign minister a highly interesting trip, and hopefully the hospitality we've shown to the representatives of our ostensible enemies will bear fruit in the form of improved relations."
SPEERUSA.113.a:0 "Where will he visit next?"

 SPEERUSA.114.t:0 "Fear and Loathing in Reno"
 SPEERUSA.114.desc:0 "Another event arranged (but not attended) by German Foreign Minister Schmidt, a German guest appearance at the Reno Air Show has (literally) turned some heads. While anyone even a year ago would have laughed at the idea of the Luftwaffe performing along with the US Air Force, attendees at the show had to admit that the German squadron was very impressive. Their maneuvers were executed flawlessly, and one hairpin turn even managed to elicit a few gasps and a small applause. It's safe to say that US-German diplomacy now has one more success under its belt."
 SPEERUSA.114.a:0 "See you again next show!"

 SPEERUSA.115.t:0 "Once upon a Time in Hollywood"
 SPEERUSA.115.desc:0 "In a gesture of goodwill, German Foreign Minister Helmut Schmidt has arranged a film festival in Hollywood to demonstrate the prowess of Germany's film industry, and to send a message that we and the Germans are not so different after all or some airy-fairy thing like that. But, we have to admit that we were pleasantly surprised and entertained by a number of quality films. Not all of them were too memorable, but one drama in particular starring a renowned comedy actor named Heinz Rühmann seemed to strike a chord with its audience.\n\nPerhaps, if relations do continue to improve, there could be a strong collaboration between our film industries, which could ultimately even lead to a strengthening of cultural ties between the US and Germany. Maybe that's getting a little ahead of ourselves, but nevertheless we can consider this evening to be a modest success."
 SPEERUSA.115.a:0 "We might be mortal enemies but who doesn't like a good movie?"

 SPEERUSA.116.t:0 "The Unity Fair Fails"
 SPEERUSA.116.desc:0 "One of several events arranged by the Germans in the US as a goodwill gesture, the Unity Fair in Boston has turned out rather unfortunately. Intended to be a grand exposition akin to the World's Fairs of decades past, the fair has instead reinforced the many negative cultural stereotypes our populace holds about Germany and its people. The site was covered head to toe in swastika-themed paraphernalia, which was a huge mistake considering that Americans do not react positively to the symbol they've learned to hate after years of German conquest and American propaganda.\n\nWhile the actual quality of the cultural and scientific displays was very impressive, the fair simply seemed to portray the Germans as humourless fanatics, which doesn't bode too well for our attempts to improve their image in the minds of the American people. Luckily, there are many more events and visits to come where this error can be rectified."
 SPEERUSA.116.a:0 ""Disunity Fair" would be a more fitting name."

 SPEERUSA.118.t:0 "Invitation to Hamburg"
 SPEERUSA.118.desc:0 "In the White House, items of interest easily disappear amongst the sea of constant busyness. Not today, however. In the Office of the United States Secretary of State, a letter from Berlin has arrived. An invitation.\n\nAmerica is a nation skeptical of the outside, and of no nation are the Yanks more suspicious than the Reich. However, an olive branch is a welcome gift in these parts, and, in a changing world, the more friends Washington has, the better. The letter was well addressed and complimentary, and the trip does sound delightful. Seeing the sights of Hamburg, a true European city of tradition and grace? Surely it couldn't be too bad.\n\n"
 SPEERUSA.118.a:0 "Pack the suitcases!"

 SPEERUSA.125.t:0 "Relocate the Protestors"
 SPEERUSA.125.desc:0 "God seems to have a special disdain for Hamburg. In 1842, the Great Fire broke out, destroying a third of the Altstadt's buildings. One hundred years later, she saw vicious bombing campaigns by the cursed British and allied forces. Just recently, 1962's North Sea Flood tested the wills of Hamburg's great citizens. Now, a rebellious plague sweeps the city, and its carrier is the fiery naivety of German youth.\n\nWe know not what the protestors demand, nor do we particularly care. All we know is that with the American's arriving in Germany, we cannot have these demonstrators crowding our streets, throwing bricks and generally making a mess of things.\n\nThankfully, a Chancellery meeting today has proved fruitful. Speer and Gehlen have sent armoured trucks and men with guns into Hamburg, quickly and effectively taking care of the rioters and moving them elsewhere. At least for now, our faces are saved."
 SPEERUSA.125.a:0 "Blitzkrieg."
