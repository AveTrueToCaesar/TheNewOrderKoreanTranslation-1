 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "불가리아 내 우리 영향력에게 가장 큰 위협이 되는게 뭘까요. 당연히 조국전선입니다. 이 유격대가 우리에게 계속 골칫거리가 되었다고요? 우리가 놈들을 산적떼로 만들어 사람들이 등을 돌리게 만든다면 이 지역 내 우리 인기를 늘릴 수 있습니다."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "우리 동맹을 잘만 꾸민다면, 불가리아군 하급 부대에 조국전선 단원들을 심어놓을 수 있는 가능성이 큽니다. 이들의 점호는 엉망입니다. 적절한 장비를 가진 채 재빨리 \"재배치 명령\"을 위조한 소수라면 군대에 빠르게 잠입할 수 있을 것입니다."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_1:0 "분견대 무장"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "전선이 점점 문제가 되고 있습니다. 불가리아 현장에 있는 경비 인원들은 소총 한 정씩을 들게 될겁니다. 우리가 더 많은 총을 보내면 불가리아는 다시 한 번 우리에게 감사할겁니다."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "차르에 대한 지지도가 계속 줄어들고 있습니다. 대중의 인식을 바꿔야 합니다. 차르를 국가에 필요한 아버지상으로 묘사해야 합니다."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_3:0 "충성파가 근위대에 잠입하도록 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Part of the reason it's so hard for us to make contact with the Tsar is that he is surrounded by Germans and their collaborator lackeys. If we funnel loyalists in the army supplies, we could get friends close to the Tsar."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_4:0 "항공 정찰"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Our enemies hide deep in the countryside. If we are going to hunt them down like the rats they are, we need to locate them. Luckily, the Luftwaffe is more than adequate for this task."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_1:0 "시메온 가택연금"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Our intelligence agents have tipped us off that the Italians are trying to get into direct contact with Tsar Simeon.

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_2:0 "반대파 협박"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "During this political turmoil, some of the Tsar's own advisors have come out of the woodworks to voice their \"concerns\". We aren't fooled; the administration is testing the waters and trying to rally support. This is unacceptable; we need to put them back in their places."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_2:0 "소문 퍼뜨리기"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "SS가 차르를 독살했다! 히틀러가 반대파를 납치해 죽음의 수용소로 보낸다! 독일 주둔군이 정부에게 총을 겨누고 협박한다! 사실이던 아니던 별 상관 없습니다. 우린 민중이 분노해 라이히에 맞서 일어나기만을 바랍니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_3:0 "불가리아군 지원 획득"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "We have more than a few friends in the Bulgarian military. It's time to call in our favors with our allies there and get their badge of approval. The Bulgarian military's support could be decisive in the coming days."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_3:0 "시위자 격려"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "The people's will must be known! The Tsar does not stand alone against the Germans; the people chafe against their occupiers. Encouraging people to rally together in the streets will show the Germans that they are not wanted in Bulgaria!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_4:0 "중립파 관료에게 뇌물 먹이기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "There are more than a few administrators in the Bulgarian government who are on the fence, so to speak. While not outright hostile to our influence, we wouldn't consider them exactly friendly either. Some cash to show our appreciation for all their hard work would win more than a few of these neutrals over to our cause."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_4:0 "독일 초소 공격"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Our allies don't have the means to directly assault German complexes yet. Small groups of Italian special operatives can be sent to Bulgaria to hit German fortifications and shake our arrogant foe's morale."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_1:0 "주둔군 배치"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "A huge wave of protesters and traitors are rising up in Sofia! If not dealt with swiftly, these people could threaten our dominance in Bulgaria. This must be stopped at once; deploy our garrison!"

 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The Fatherland Front is nearly ready to take back their capital! However, they have no real plan other than to take to the streets en mass. This will not do; we shall send some of our professional army staff officers to help them plan the uprising."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_2:0 "알려진 지도자 체포"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to the Bulgarian administration, our intelligence agents have a list of known Fatherland Front members; a number of them which are key organizers in the party. Arresting these organizers and leaders will throw this \"uprising\" into disarray."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_2:0 "독일 주둔군 교란"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "The biggest obstacle the uprising is going to face is the hardened German garrison in Sofia. If we send some of our own men in plain clothes to hit the German's logistics, we could potentially draw a large number of them out of the city on a fruitless chase through the countryside."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_3:0 "차르를 소피아에서 빼내기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "The Tsar is proving to be problematic. He himself is not keen on continued German influence in Bulgaria, and an endorsement of this rebellion by him could prove disastrous. For his own \"security\" and \"safety\", we could move him out of the city temporarily."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_3:0 "대중 무장시키기"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "To no surprise, a large number of the common folks in Sofia are sick and tired of the rampant German dominance of their country. Arming these people would greatly increase the revolt's chances of success."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_4:0 "무장한 시위꾼에게 사격"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "Armed mobs have taken to the streets. The situation is tense, but no street fighting has broken out... yet. We can not tolerate such open defiance; any citizen wielding a firearm shall be shot on sight by our men!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_4:0 "할 수 있는 모든 부탁"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "Bulgarians in government positions all over the country owe us favors. Police chiefs, army officers, administrators and more owe us, and there's no better time to collect our favors than now."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_5:0 "증원군 요청"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "It's clear; we don't have enough German boots on the ground to contain this uprising. We need more men in the field if we are going to remain in control of Sofia."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_5:0 "군 내 점조직 활동 개시"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "During the last couple of months, we've gotten a number of Fatherland Front agents into the Bulgarian Army. It's time to activate these agents to sow confusion and disarray in the rank. This will slow down their response times, and give the uprising a better chance at success."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "Though our relationship with Hungary has soured over the decade, we still have a number of friends in high places from the glory days of the Reich. Reconnecting with them would be a good first step towards mending our relationship with them."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_1:0 "이탈리아 대표단 파견"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "It has been nearly a decade since an Italian delegation has been sent to Hungary. If we want to repair our damaged relations with them, we need to send some of our higher ranker officials to show that we're serious, and want to work with them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_2:0 "화살십자당 후원"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "During the Second World War, the best of all the Hungarians were part of the Arrow Cross party. Ferociously nationalistic and aware of the danger of the Eternal Jew, the Arrow Cross is the Hungarian equivalent of the Nazi party. They are our natural allies, and are worthy of our funding. Their gratitude will be well worth the cost."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_2:0 "헝가리 대사관 재개장"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "Ever since our relations with Germany collapsed in the 50s, the Hungarian embassy has been closed due to their alignment with Germany. Times have changed, however. Reopening the embassy would be a good first step to establishing our ties with the Hungarian government."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_3:0 "준군사조직 훈련"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Paramilitaries in Hungary are almost exclusively nationalistic patriots aghast at Hungary's embarrassing defeats in the 50s. These men would be thrilled and indebted to us if we help train these zealous patriots."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_3:0 "좋은 무역협정 제안"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Trade between the Italian and Hungarian markets is almost non-existent at the moment. We can change this by offering the Hungarian government favorable import and export rates to encourage more trade."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_4:0 "독일의 제한 무시"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Technically, the Reich has a plethora of trade and diplomatic restrictions in place that any foreign countries need to deal with when trying to establish relations with a member of their so called \"Pakt\". In reality, these restrictions are nothing more than formalities. We can safely ignore them at the expense of our already deteriorating relations with the Reich."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_1:0 "요원 배치"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "The German minority along the Danube is rather sizable. The Hungarian government tends to leave those who pay their taxes alone, and Aryans are certainly no expectation. A few more German faces amongst the crowds won't raise suspicions..."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_2_decision_1:0 "헝가리 외교관을 위한 호화로운 파티"

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_3:0 "소규모 워게임 주최"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The Italian and French armies haven't really worked together since the 20s. As a show of goodwill and trust, we should host some small scale wargames so both their and our men can interact with each other and forge new bonds and a sense of comradery."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_4:0 "해군 훈련 주최"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "The French aren't only focusing on their land forces; they have for years supported a small but efficient coast guard. Hosting some naval exercise costs us little and increases our cohesion and relations with the French."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Since our falling out with the Reich, the French-Italian border has been closed off, and only a chosen few are able to cross it.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_5:0 "육군을 위한 화포"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_5_desc:0 "The French army lacks heavy guns even more than they do for small arms. Regular French divisions pack nearly no punch as a result, and as it stands would be smashed in any conventional confrontation.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_6:0 "지원장비 보내기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_6_desc:0 "It's as if the French army has produced nothing for their men for two decades! Even the most basic equipment, like radios, is absent from their stockpiles. How their army even functions is beyond our understanding. Some basic support equipment would be put to good use by the French."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_1:0 "라이히에서 프랑스인 노예 해방"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "The Italians are making a strong bid to win over the French. We can not be outdone by them; releasing French slaves that work in the Reich will counter Italian influence and help us repair our relations with France."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_1:0 "프랑스 시민들에게 배상"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Many French natives within the Italian Empire have suffered injustice under our administration.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "One of our dirtier secrets is the goings on in Burgundy. Life even for Aryans is harsh; the SS squeeze all the value out of all life in that blasted hell hole. There are slaves that are too ill or weak for work that the Ordensstaat does not care about; we can purchase these folks and set them free, returning them to France."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "Thousands of French soldiers who fought against us in the Second World War are still rotting away in prison camps. Old, demoralized, and quite frankly a drain on resources, these men are literally good for nothing.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_3:0 "프랑스계 코르시카인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "For over a decade, French citizens living on Corsica have chaffed under Italian administration.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_4:0 "프랑스인 노예 \"배상\""
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Some of our recently freed slaves have worked for as long as two decades with little to no pay under brutal working conditions.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_4:0 "프랑스계 알제리인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "French Algeria has always been a harsh colony to survive in, and the change in administration has not been kind for the French community there.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_5:0 "프랑스계 시리아인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_5_desc:0 "The French community in Syria has always been small. Comparatively privileged compared to other settlers, the French here has still lost many of the boons they once had when the Italian administration moved in. A good portion of them would be more than willing to make the return trip home to France if given the opportunity."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_6:0 "본토 프랑스인에게 이주 기회 제안"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_6_desc:0 "Although their living conditions are heads and shoulders above their compatriots in the colonies, many French citizens in our mainland European conquests have nonetheless not been thrilled to live under what they see as a foreign occupation.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_7:0 "동아프리카 프랑스인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_7_desc:0 "Compared to their fellow countrymen in the other colonies, the few French living in East Africa have more or less continued to live a hard life in the harsh environment around the horn of Africa. Most of these settlers are poor and always have been. An opportunity to move to France, sponsored by the government no less will have many men jumping at the opportunity to finally leave the poor poverty stricken colony."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The French do not get to just \"up and leave\" the Pakt! They owe us subservience, and they're dependent on us for everything!

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_1:0 "프랑스 경제 투자"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The French economy has been stagnant for over fifty years.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_2:0 "프랑스 해안에서 해군 훈련"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Something France totally lacks is a navy.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_2:0 "전차 선물"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "German stipulations stipulated that the French could not operate their own armored formations.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Sometimes, blunt words face to face is the simplest way to convey a message. Our message will be short; leave the Pakt and throw your lot in with the traitorous Italians, and there will be dire consequences."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_3:0 "서해안 항구 개발"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "French docks have been seriously neglected. To make matters worse for them, their largest one in the north have been taken from them. Luckily, there are plenty of perfect locations on their west coast for potential, large dockyards."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "It's hard to really blame our men in Serbia for not wiping out the various partisans fighting us since many of the garrisons have a critical lack of heavy guns. Considering that most of the rebel encampments are hidden deep in fortified mountain and forest strongholds, it's suicidal to just assault them without heavy firepower.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "Tents, clothes, bedding, soap, and more! The refugees in Serbia desperately need more of everything we can think of! We need to send supplies at once!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Build New Worker Camps"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "The refugee camps are simply overcrowded and not optimized for large scale work projects. Building new, specialized work camps kills two birds with one stone; it greatly improves the living conditions of the workers while giving them an opportunity to work for pays."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_2:0 "Send Vehicles"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "There is a serious bottleneck on the poorly maintained Serbian roads; the antique vehicles that are currently being used by the various humanitarian agencies at work frequently break down, and to top it off can carry very little cargo. Sending some of our heavy duty military trucks would help out the situation on the ground a lot."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Fund Infrastructure Projects"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "Thousands still stand jobless and stuck in the refugee camps. Why not put them to work ourselves? We could personally fund a series of infrastructure construction projects; bridges, ditches, drainage systems, road construction, and more if we so choose."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_3:0 "Send Foodstuffs and Essentials"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "It isn't a secret; most of the refugees have nothing to their names except the clothes on their backs. As more and more people congregate to the camps, less and less food is available for all, and the incoming immigrants certainly aren't bringing more foodstuffs with them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Introduce Ration Cards"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "Not every man, woman, and child will be able to get a steady job and be able to work their ways to a new home without support. We can help out the people on the ground by introducing ration cards; this will encourage the people to do menial work around the camp in exchange for extra goods, services, and even money."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_4:0 "Donate to the Red Cross"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "The men and women on the field, the doctors and nurses of the Red Cross are truly doing God's work in Serbia. Asking for no payments, these volunteers have been providing life saving services to the thousands of refugees in need. Our money would be well sent if we gave a donation to the Red Cross."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Loan Military Engineers"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "Engineers, especially for bridge building, are in high demand, and there aren't enough in Serbia to go around. We could send some of our experts from the army over to help design and build these projects in vital areas."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_1:0 "Find Nationalists in the Government"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "It is well known that there is much resentment towards the German occupation in the Serbian collaboration government. It wouldn't take much looking to feel out and find nationalists who would like to see nothing more than the Hun kicked out of Serbia."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Invest in the Civilian Economy"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Foreign investments in Serbia have been nearly non-existent for over a decade. The region is just not attractive to foreign interests, despite its potential. That is where we come in; some smart investments in the right sectors could help give the Serbian economy the boost it needs to get on its feet."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_2:0 "Infiltrate the Camps"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Getting eyes in the many refugee and work camps dotted around the countryside would be straightforward and easy. Serbian nationalist agitators like to sneak into these camps to rile up their countrymen. It would be simple enough to make contact with these men if we tried."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Improve Rail Lines"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "Rail lines in Serbia are in a sorry state. Decay and disuse has taken its toll; the country has terribly few functioning lines, which is effectively a bottleneck for economic development. A concentrated effort to build and improve the rail lines would be a great stimulus boost for the local economy."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_3:0 "Scout Out the Countryside"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The bulk of the Serbian resistance hides out in the vast, rugged countryside of Serbia. Finding the partisans in their own backyard will not be an easy task, but it should be one that we undertake if we are going to establish connections with the anti-German elements there."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Hammer Out a Trade Deal"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "The deal needs to be altered. Trade between us and Serbia is simply not profitable for either country; barely any goods flow between our two nations. We can change stipulations to get more German goods on their market, and in exchange we can buy raw materials like iron and coal for cheap. The Serbians will not be pleased to be forced into a trade treaty with no say, but it must be done."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_4:0 "Find Sleeper Cells in the Cities"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Discontent in the urban centers has simmered for a number of years. We know for a fact that there are nationalist cells underground around the country; we just don't know where. We could send our agents around to find them and make contact with these potential allies."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_5:0 "Sell Arms Licenses"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_5_desc:0 "Serbia has no domestic arms industry, so to speak. This is a shame, since there is much money to be made selling armaments. We could sell arms licenses to our allies, who could then use said license to turn a pretty penny in sales."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Form Air Cavalry"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Fighting against units who hit, then run into the woods is a royal pain. Raids against German and our collaborator allies are becoming more and more frequent; it has been proposed that in response, we form a specialized task force with unprecedented mobility to counter sudden threats. They would also be quite useful on the offensive..."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_1:0 "Supply Nationalists With Arms"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "The Resistance in Serbia, on further analysis, is in a pitiful state. Only the most hardened and seasoned men have serviceable equipment; way too many of these \"freedom fighters\" are no more than men with sticks. A generous donation of rifles will make short work of this sorry state of affairs."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Reinforce Our Garrisons"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Many of our garrisons we've deployed to Serbia are equipped with second rate firearms and other tools. This is unacceptable! Proper German soldiers deserve only the best; these men should be given new guns at once!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_2:0 "Train the Guerillas"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Although there are a few partisans who have been fighting the Germans for over two decades, many of the fighters here are young, green, and haven't seen any fighting apart from taking pot-shots from the woods. They wouldn't stand up to a Russian mob, let alone trained soldiers from the Wehrmacht. These fighters need some serious training."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Ship in Heavy Guns"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "Our men on the field don't have the punch to really give the rebels they fight a good bashing. Our garrisons are assaulted again and again, but we don't have the firepower to make such assaults really punishing. That changes now; heavy artillery will change that dynamic in no time."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_3:0 "Smuggle in Heavy Guns"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "The Germans operate armored cars throughout the region as mobile patrol units. German garrisons are likewise hardened fortifications; assaulting these compounds and patrols is suicidal. Or rather, it is without any heavy ordnance. We certainly have plenty of missile launchers laying around; why not send some of them where they can be put to good use?"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Send more Men!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Ever since we've started our occupation of Serbia, the garrison has always lacked the necessary manpower to properly garrison the small country. This has finally come to haunt us, and now we're dealing with multiple organized resistance groups. We must send more men if we are going to keep our hold on the country."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_4:0 "Provide Explosives to Urban Partisans"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Satchel charges are super destructive and can do a ton of damage in the right hands. These have limited impact in the country however, but in an urban setting, large explosions are perfect for sowing terror..."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_5:0 "Attach an Air Squadron"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_5_desc:0 "One of our key advantages we have over any partisan group that resists the Reich is total air superiority. Why Serbia hasn't been deemed important enough to warrant a small attachment is beyond us, but it's better late than never that we send some planes. These would be a huge help in fighting the rabbles in the forests."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_6:0 "Get Our Men Tanks"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_6_desc:0 "It is an expensive investment, but also a practicable one. There is no way untrained partisans can stand up to and fight a Panzer formation, much less disable one. A small panzer formation is just what our garrisons need to keep the rebels on their toes, and make them think twice before attacking us."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Spread Anti-Italian Propaganda"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The Italians are the true enemies of the Serbian peoples. It is the Italians, not us, who keep the Serb peoples from being united in one country. It is the Italians, not us, who caused the massive refugee crisis and forced tens of thousands to flee to the last free place the Serbians can call home. We sure won't let them forget it."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_1:0 "Spread Anti-German Propaganda"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "It is the Germans who have made Serbia the poverty stricken rump state it is today. They care not for anyone but themselves, and only occupy Serbia so they can drain it of all its life blood. They're rapists and killers, and everyone should know."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Give More Handouts to Refugees"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Many of the refugees are becoming restless. This isn't a huge concern, but it still makes our administration look bad. We could temporarily placate them by giving most upset refugees some extra supplies, and maybe even a few luxuries."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_2:0 "Spread Nationalist Rhetoric"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "The Serbs are a great people. Always steadfast in defense of their country, they aren't afraid to face off against the odds for their people and homes, and today is no different. All Serbians rise up! We will throw out the Germans!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Expose the Race War in Albania"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Hundreds of Serbs have been killed in Albania this last decade, and thousands more forced to flee for their lives while the Italians watched. For all our shortcomings, we haven't allowed state sanctioned genocide to occur here; lets let the people know that the Italians aren't heroes."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_3:0 "Rile Up the Refugees"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Poor, dirty, hungry, and trapped, the refugee camps are a literal ticking time bomb before they explode into rioting. The Germans are still keeping immigrants and refugees in the camps, often against their will. It wouldn't take much to rile up these angry people."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Improve Conditions in the Camps"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "Many of our camps are still overfilled. Shortages of everything, from boots to medical supplies are in short supply. The Serbian refugees need a large amount of goods, and we can easily supply them if we so choose."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_4:0 "Sit Down With the Resistance"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "The many resistance groups of Serbia, while brave, do not work well together. It's a shame; a united front against the Germans would be a force to be reckoned with. We should gather the various groups into a room and help them iron out their differences. If we could get them to work together; the partisans as a whole would be much more dangerous and effective."
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Praise German Generosity!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "\"The Serbians have flourished under our administration! German generosity has seen the state rise from a rabble run Communist wasteland to a glorious, independent state! They still have a ways to go, of course, but the Serbians have come far under German direction!\""
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_5:0 "Expose Horrid Work Camp Conditions"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "It's even worse than we thought. The Serbian \"work camps\" more resemble the disgusting concentration camps from World War II than a public works program to help get hard workers up on their feet. The rest of Serbia needs to see what the Germans are doing to their countrymen!"
